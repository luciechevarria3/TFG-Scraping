An installment in The Legend of Zelda series, it was released worldwide in December 2009. The game was re released for the Wii U Virtual Console in October 2016.\n\nLike its predecessors The Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks features a cel-shaded art style. Link, the protagonist of Spirit Tracks, travels across the game's overworld using a cannon-equipped steam train much like the steamboat in Phantom Hourglass. The player is also able to control Phantoms, and play an instrument known as the Spirit Flute.",
