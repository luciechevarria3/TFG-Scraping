It’s the full-featured version!\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: This extension will only work if you have the Cyclonis Password Manager desktop application already installed on your computer. You may download the FREE \"Cyclonis Password Manager Desktop\" application from the Microsoft Store.\r\n\r\n \r\nUsing just a single password for multiple online accounts? Is keeping track of your many passwords an impossible task? With Cyclonis Password Manager, you can manage, organize and control all your passwords in one central place. Cyclonis Password Manager stores your data in a personal vault, that is encrypted with AES-256 bit, an encryption algorithm used by governments, financial institutions, and in military applications. \r\n\r\nCyclonis Password Manager encrypts your vault using your master password. Your master password is for your eyes only – your data cannot even be accessed by Cyclonis staff or servers as we never transmit or store your master password.\r\n\r\nSigning up to a new social media website? This means that you should create a new and unique password. Let Cyclonis Password Manager take care of this tedious process for you. Using Cyclonis Password Manager’s password generator, you can create complex passwords that are designed to help avert the most popular password-cracking methods. Of course, no password, no matter how complex, can be 100% guaranteed against being compromised. Best of all, you can save your new social media account’s login details to your Cyclonis Password Manager vault, accessible directly from your web browser. The next time you visit that social media website, Cyclonis Password Manager’s browser extension can auto-fill your username and password, and even log you in automatically.\r\n\r\nThere's no point in having your data consolidated if you can't easily access it. This is where the Cyclonis Password Manager browser extension comes in. It automatically connects to the Cyclonis Password Manager desktop application and enters your login details for you for each website that you have stored in your vault, saving you time and the frustration of having to manually type your login details. Just navigate to the website and let Cyclonis Password Manager’s browser extension automatically fill in the username and password fields. It can even be configured to log you in automatically by activating the “Sign in” button. There’s no typing, no copying, and no pasting.\r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n\r\n- View, add, edit, delete, and manage your passwords from a searchable vault.\r\n- Use your passwords in multiple browsers on multiple devices.\r\n- Search your vault and navigate to your favorite websites with just a few clicks.\r\n- Log in to your favorite websites automatically. \r\n- Option to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your Cyclonis Password Manager account.\r\n- The Cyclonis Password Manager Password Generator helps you create complex passwords and update your website accounts.\r\n- The Cyclonis Password Manager Password Analyzer checks the complexity and strength of your website account passwords.\r\n-  Integrates with your browser to enable you to store your usernames and passwords to your Cyclonis Password Manager vault with a few clicks.\r\n- Automatically fill in long registration forms and checkout pages with the profile data that you have stored in your vault.\r\n- Import your website account usernames and passwords from other password managers.\r\n- View and edit your website accounts, Private Notes, personal profiles, ID documents, credit card details, bank account information and other sensitive data.",

In order to white-list a domain, please add the desired domain to the bypass area in toolbar popup. For example, to white-list - https://www.foobar.com - please add - *foobar.com - to the filed. Please note that all the entries should be comma separated. Once you filled the bypass area, please mark the related checkbox as well (the checkbox next to the Bypass category).\n\nIn order to set PAC proxy, please add a PAC URL to the designated area (PATH input area). Please note that a PAC path should have a certain format. For example if your PAC file is located in - C:// - folder (on windows machine), please write - file:///C:/pac.data - in the PATH area. If you do not know how to write a PAC file, please read this (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config) Wikipedia page.

    "description": "This extension protects user privacy by prevents the HTML canvas element from being used by malicious scripts for fingerprinting the user. This extension adds a slight noise to the data generated by the canvas element when certain methods are being called. This way the canvas element cannot be used for fingerprinting purposes. Compared to other similar extensions, this one is lighter and uses a more effective method to block fingerprinting from all frame elements (top and subframes). The extension supports three modes of operation:\n\n  1. Random noise\n  2. Random noise (per session) (to have a fixed identity for current page session)\n  3. Fixed noise (to have a fixed but unique identity all the time)\n\nFeatures:\n  1. Fingerprint defender with as minimum footprint as possible\n  2. Block or disable fingerprint on certain hostnames\n  3. Notify when the canvas fingerprint is detected\n  4. Disable notification for a few hostnames or for all hostnames.\n  5. Works on cross-origin (CORS) and sandboxed iframes (like Disqus and Hangouts)\n\nNotes:\n  1. There is no on and off button as the extension is not meant to be disabled. If there is a use case of the on and off button please report on the FAQs page (review section)\n  2. This extension does not block the canvas element entirely. It only modifies two methods to prevent the JavaScript engine from generating a unique identification key from this element.\n\nWhat is Canvas Fingerprinting:\nCanvas fingerprinting is one of a number of browser fingerprinting techniques for tracking online users that allow websites to identify and track visitors using the HTML5 canvas element instead of browser cookies or other similar means. Canvas fingerprinting works by exploiting the HTML5 canvas element. When a user visits a page, the fingerprinting script first draws text with the font and size of its choice and adds background colors. Next, the script calls Canvas API's ToDataURL method to get the canvas pixel data in dataURL format, which is basically a Base64 encoded representation of the binary pixel data. Finally, the script takes the hash of the text-encoded pixel data, which serves as the fingerprint.\n\nIt is recommended to install an adblocker extension along with this defender (e.g. uBlock Origin or Adblock Plus).",

    "description": "Vimium C is an open source browser extension that provides keyboard-based inner-page navigation, browser tab operations, and an enhanced search panel, so you may take full advantages of your browser without a mouse or touchpad.\n\nIt supports all original commands of Vimium and some new useful commands (a full list can be seen in a help dialog in the Vimium C Options page). And it can map a same key sequence to different commands for different websites (and/or for different active elements in page).\n\nFor example:\n* press `f` to hint all clickable elements of the current web page\n* press `o` to show a search panel (\"Vomnibar\", a safe iframe) to search in your history, bookmarks, opened tabs and configured search engines, and you can even remove a history or tab by selecting a search result and pressing Shift+Delete\n* press j, k, h, l to scroll down/up/left/right on web pages\n* press \"/\" to search for text; press \"v\" to enter Visual Mode (just like VIM)\n* press Shift+J, Shift+K, `g0`, `g$` to switch to the previous/next/first/last tab\n* press `x` to remove a tab, and Shift+X to restore recently closed tabs (sessions), and many other commands\n* command repetition: for example, pressing `5X` (`5`, Shift+X) will restore 5 recent closed tabs\n* configure key mappings to bind Vimium C's tens of commands to other key sequences, and add options to switch command behaviors\n* apply block lists and allow lists of key mappings on configurable special websites and URLs\n\nIt can copy any selected text and current tab's title and URL to the system clipboard, and read the clipboard to search the copied text using a specified search engine.\n\nIt can also enable/disable websites' image loading and even JavaScript execution, if you trigger its command \"toggleCS\". This functionality requires a permission of \"Change your settings that control websites' access to features such as cookies, JavaScript ...\", and Vimium C promises that it won't do any thing secretly, but only act on what key sequences you press.\n\nIt will provide 8 \"global\" browser shortcuts: createTab, previousTab, nextTab, reloadTab, and some others, so you may bind some key sequences to them, and then these commands will work even when a page has no focus (e.g. when the browser address bar is focused).\n\nIt will register an omnibox keyword \"v\", and if you input \"v\" and press Space on the browser address bar (omnibox), you can do searches for history, bookmarks and tabs just like you're inputting on its Vomnibar.\n\nIt supports encoded URLs, and you can search Chinese, Japanese and Korean words in URLs of history and bookmarks. You may configure it to decode URLs in a charset of your locale .\n\nIt will download all synced settings from the Internet during the first installation, and you may enable/disable the syncing on certain computers.\n\nIf you have any exclusion rule for key mappings, it will monitor browser tab URL changes to re-check whether a new URL matches your URL pattern list.\n\nVimium C may show a notification when it gets upgraded to a new minor version.\n\nFor more information about release notes, rebinding your keys and how to use many of Vimium C's features, please see here: https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c#readme , or https://gitee.com/gdh1995/vimium-c#git-readme . There're also wiki pages.\n\n## Special note\n\nThe developer (gdh1995) can not use the comment functionality of Microsoft Edge Add-ons (I don't know why), so if you meet any question or bug, please go to https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c/issues and file an issue.\n\n## Declaration for Applicable Regions\n\nWhen people in \"all regions\" visit this store, Vimium C and other extensions published by [gdh1995](https://github.com/gdh1995) are always available.\nBut This behavior is only to make these extensions easier to use, but DOES NOT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED the author (gdh1995) \"agrees or has no objection to\" that \"Taiwan\" can be parallel to \"China\", which was an **inappropriate** status quo in the stores' pages on 2021-06-03.\n\nAccording to [The Constitution of the People's Republic of China](http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/c505/201803/e87e5cd7c1ce46ef866f4ec8e2d709ea.shtml) and international consensus, Taiwan is an inalienable part of the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China.",

    "description": "# gimme gimme gimme\nA WebExtension for downloading media from webpages, especially tuned downloading image galleries with thumbnails that point to detail pages with large versions of the image on them. It also supports downloading the media shown on a page, and digging galleries of galleries. You'll find code for experimental features for downloading audio and for downloading video (the buttons are just hidden), but the gallery digging is always priority #1.\n\nTwo terms are used for the automatic media-finding: Dig and Scrape. Dig is for galleries, and galleries of galleries -- sites where one must dig into the detail pages to find the original media. Scrape is for getting media that is directly on the page.\n\nAs mentioned before, code is there to download video and audio files as well, but is not currently exposed and has not been tested much. Feel free to un-hide the extra buttons in popup/style.css to download the other media types. The event handlers and back-end are all set up, just the buttons are hidden.\n\nThis extension works with Chrome, Firefox, and Edge -- it can be found in all three extension stores in addition to in this repo.\n\n\n# v0.4.13\nBugfixes were plentiful. Lots of valid images were being discarded for nitpicky ivory-tower-only reasons. Upgraded npm packages too.\n\nUpdated options/preferences page to work again.\n\n# v0.4.14 \nGlaring problems that plagued v0.4.13 have been tracked-down and fixed!! The v0.4.14 branch was finally created and dedicated to making GimmeGimmeGimme a better product. That's the priority, getting you the media desired repeatably and faster. Those TypeScript and gallery-def \"ML\" bits will wait. (See \"The Future\" below.)\nLazy-loaded thumbnails for a gallery always resulted in only one media match, as all the thumbUris point to the same thumbnail image file at the same at the time of the gallery\ncraping. Now, when dupe thumb uri values are found, they are salted in their querystring with an extra param. This fixes about 80% of the times Gimme would fail miserably and only\nreturn one zoom-item! Now, with the salting, the map structures are resiliant in the face of these lazy, tricky galleries, and the full-sized linked zoom-media gets correctly identified, harvested, and presented as options. The text for the options is already correct, but for clarity we need to add a built-in thumb image to semantically represent what's going on.\nTensorFlow classifications were getting their Promise resolves and rejections seriously messed-up. Some code paths failed to yield any type of resolution whatsoever, and that was why there were so many near-permanent hangs only recoverable via reloading the extension or quitting and restarting the browser. The bugs were deep and convoluted in our promise structures built for the TF classifications, and took a lot of teasing out. Now the damn thing works way more reliably, and doesn't waste your time by processing 90% of a huge gallery-gallery-dig only to stop dead and piss you off.\nMeanwhile: the webpack and babel usage has been further refined, libs have been pegged to specific versions, downloading has had its perf improved a bit, comments have been iterated on, some code naming issues are better, and it's on a more alright trajectory again.\nOther stuff and fixes etc la la la who fucking cares. The new mantra is RELIABILITY AND USABILITY. This is still just code-noodling at the end of the day, but it shouldn't make you want to pull your hair out from frustration.\nThe best update so far is the \"go back to the top\" arrow in the popup. Oh, Totally",

This is available for a free trial period with no credit card required. If you decide that's not for you, the add-on can instead work with the free KeePass Password Safe 2 software and we offer step by step instructions for how to install and configure that to work on your Windows machine (and it can also be made to work on Mac and Linux with a bit more effort, with multiple guides existing to help in that endeavour)\n\n★ Who we are\n\nKee has been the most highly rated Mozilla Firefox password management extension for nearly 10 years! We recently changed our icon to coincide with the launch of the extension in browsers other than Firefox and the announcement of the Kee Vault password manager service.\n\nYou can look forward to even more improvements in future and join the discussion on the community forum at https://forum.kee.pm/ to let us know what features you'd most like to see developed next.\n\n★ Having trouble?\n\nIf you would like to try Kee and it is not working for you, please use the help resources at https://forum.kee.pm/t/help-and-support/24 since requests for support within review comments will remain un-noticed for a year or longer.\n\nYou should pay particular attention to the full detailed installation instructions at https://forum.kee.pm/t/installing-kee-instructions/23, the getting started tutorial at https://tutorial-addon.kee.pm/ and any advice at the top of that page.\n\n★ Permissions\n\nKee needs a variety of permissions to deliver it's functionality to you. We maintain a page that details these permissions and why we require them at https://www.kee.pm/extension-permissions/.\n\nThe built-in Edge password manager will no longer prompt you to save passwords after you install this add-on. Any existing data will not be affected but you are strongly advised to delete any stored passwords from your Edge password store in order to increase the security of your personal data and to avoid possible confusion in future.",

Main and most requested feature: this blocker has a customizable white list, so you may add your favorite sites to exclude from blocking autoplay. To deactivate a function, simply uncheck the related item from toolbar-panel. With this extension you will never have to worry about videos auto playing in the background.

If yes, then the Copyfish free OCR software is for you.\n\nCommon reasons to extract text from images are to google it, store it, email it or translate it. Until now, your only option was to retype the text. Copyfish is soooo much faster and more fun.\n\n“Images” come in many forms: photographs, charts, diagrams, screenshots, PDF documents, comics, error messages, memes, Flash – and Youtube movies.\n\nYou can verify the results in one glance with the extracted text overlay.\n\nDo you need to switch between OCR languages often? You can define \"Quick Switch\" buttons for up to three languages on the settings page.\n\nFor language learners: There are many translator addons available, but they only work with plain website text. Text inside images, in tricky Javascript/AJAX or, especially, in movie subtitles on Youtube or Youku is unreachable for them. But not for Copyfish. And if you want, Copyfish also translates the text for you. Especially for the subtitle translation use case, Copyfish has a repeat feature. Mark the area of the subtitle once and then use the \"Do OCR\" button to grab the latest text from the movie screen.\n\nFor developers: Copyfish is published under the GPL open-source license. As OCR software, it uses the free OCR API from https://ocr.space/ .\n\nQUESTIONS? SUGGESTIONS? Please email copyfish@ocr.space",

    "description": "Adding productivity features to Google Meet to enhance your meetings.\nMeet TurboMeet for your Google Meet. ;)\n\nAdding features, automation, and productivity quirks that enhance your meetings over Google Meet to a whole new level. \n\nTurboMeet is a must-have extension if you want to have productive and efficient meetings over Google Meet. This extension was made to help all the users participating in numerous meetings, classes, and events happening over Google Meet.\n\n\nFeatures added:\n\n1. Set the default Google Account:\nWhen you have multiple Google accounts and you join a meet link to realize that it's not linked to the correct Google account, you have to switch the accounts to join with the right one manually. Instead, set the Google Account Number (https://imgur.com/a/58dSAWS) - usually as 0, 1, 2, to auto-redirect to the correct Google Account.\n\n2. Auto Join:\nBypass the intermediary screen and directly join the meeting.\n\n3. Auto Mute Audio and Video:\nNo need to manually mute audio and video for every meeting. It's done automatically for you.\n\n4. Push to Talk:\nYou can unmute and speak by enabling the push to talk feature. We now support Space and Left Shift keys. Just press and hold the key to speak, and when done, release the key. Its that simple. If you need to mute/unmute, simply tap the key.\n\n5. Auto Enable Captions:\nCaptions are turned on by default when you enter the meeting.\n\n6. Copy URL button:\nIt's a tedious process to share just the meeting URL with another person. We have a quick solution for that.\n\n7. Quit the meeting using keys:\nJust press 'Ctrl' + 'Q' to quit any meeting directly. No more awkwardly searching for the \"End Call\" button.\n\n\n\nCheck the options page to enable or disable these features depending on your requirements.\n\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nWe don't store your data. Period.  \n\nAcknowledgments:\nSourabh Jain [https://github.com/sourabh10995] for helping me out with the development of this extension.\nMithun Mohan [https://dribbble.com/mthnmhn] for the designs and icons.\n\nIf anyone wants to contribute to the project, please do let me know.\n\nUpcoming features:\n\n1. Ability to select the Google account (Including your profile details instead of the numbers)\n2. Raise the Hands feature\n3. More keys for Push To Talk\n4. Record Meeting to the main screen.\n5. Jump to Google Meet Tab from anywhere when you click on the extension\n\nPlease spread the word!\n",

Ads that streamer embeds directly into the stream will be shown.\n\n• “Audio only” mode. Ideal for music listening.\n\n• The extension automatically opens chests with bonus points in chat.\n\n• You can set the size and location of the chat, even while in full-screen mode.\n\n• In chat (for example, attached to the bottom or top side of the window) there is room for much more messages and emotes.\n\n• You can completely disable the chat: it will not consume computer resources, and you will not be in the chatters list.\n\n• Allows you to select the device for audio output (if more than one device is available): speakers, headphones, TV, etc.\n\n• Changes volume by mouse wheel.\n\n• You can colorize the player interface to your liking.\n\n• Takes up less RAM.\n\n• Rapid start-up of the player. This is especially noticeable on slower computers.\n\n• Allows you to disable stretching the small video to the player size.\n\n• Allows you to continue viewing the broadcast in another player, for example Media Player Classic, VLC Media Player, or MX Player.\n\n• Large number of useful (and not so) settings.\n\nThe extension during installation requires the following permissions:\n\n• Read and change your data on a number of websites where Twitch stores its video. The list of websites may expand over time.\n\n• Manage your apps, extensions, and themes. Actually the extension just reads the list of installed extensions. This is necessary in order to load into the chat only those extensions that you have installed yourself in your browser. Only the following browser extensions can work in chat: BetterTTV, FrankerFaceZ and FFZ Add-On Pack.\n\nAlso read the Privacy Policy (link on this page) for further details.\n\nThe player can playback only live broadcasts and does not affect playback of videos.\n\nI do not recommend using the extension without a mouse, because touch screen support is incomplete.\n\nIf you have problems with the extension, first read the help. To do this, in the player right click the view area, then in the menu click “Help”. If you still have questions, then in the same menu click \"Send Feedback\". If you cannot start the player, send an e-mail to the extension developer. The e-mail address is located somewhere on this page.\n\nThis extension is not an official Twitch application. The extension was created by independent developer, who is not affiliated with Twitch Interactive, Inc company in any way. The extension inserts part of the Twitch.tv website — chat — into extension player.\n\nThe extension is also available for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers.",

All major browsers have the ability to gather your digital fingerprints during your browsing session, thus creating your personal tracking\nprofile – your digital fingerprint! \n\nThese unique profiles are then sold to advertising agencies,\nresulting in so-called “personalized” popups, commercials and other forms of ads.\nFurthermore, that information can also be abused if it reaches the wrong hands.\nIDX Privacy allows you to proactively deny such profiling and tracking attempts. Without affecting your browsing experience, IDX Privacy will block all tracking attempts made by either cookies, fingerprinting algorithms or other tracking methods – thus allowing you to browse the internet without any personal information leaked.\nBe it your browsing habits, shopping preferences, or social activity – that information is now all yours to keep for yourself.\n\nAd Blocker!\nSurf the web safely and conveniently without being annoyed by flashing banners and distracting ads.\nThe Ad Blocking feature will block both static and dynamic banners, making your browsing experience smoother and faster.\n\nKey Features:\n• Fingerprinting Log Detection and Protection\n• Hiding Personal Information\n• Masking Browsing Preferences\n• Blocking Third Party Trackers\n• Hiding Browser Data\n• Ad Blocker",

(Fluff Busting) Purity hides all the ads, game spam, sponsored posts and other annoying stuff on Facebook and generally makes Facebook less annoying to use\n\nIf you like F.B. Purity, please be sure to:\n★ Give it a 5 Star review and share with your friends! :)\n★ Donate to the project: https://donate.fbpurity.com to support all the hard work that goes into producing F.B. Purity.\n\nFor the latest news and info such as updates and bug fixes, please make sure you like the F.B. Purity Fan Page on Facebook via the following shortcut: \nhttps://fans.fbpurity.com\n\n\nF.B. Purity cleans the application spam and other annoying messages off your Facebook homepage. It adds a small information bar at the top of your Facebook homepage / news feed. It tells you how many game/application posts its hidden and also how many other \"Extra\" post types (which you can specify in the options screen) it has hidden. The options screen is accessible by clicking the FBP link in the top Navigation Bar.\n\nHeres a list of the different post types you can hide:\n\nFacebook Questions (and answers), Became friends with, Liked page (became a fan), Joined a group, Attending an event, Attended an event, Created an event, Changed location (Checked in/Travelling to/Travelled to), Updated profile, Changed profile picture, Updated Cover Photo, Changed relationship, Commented on or likes status, Uploaded photo, Tagged in (aka mentioned in), likes or commented on photo, Tagged in, likes or commented on album, Uploaded video, Tagged in video, Posted a link, Commented on or likes link, Posted a note, Tagged in note, Commented on wall, Commented on group wall, Commented on page wall, Wrote on Timeline (User,Page,Group,Event etc Timelines), Hide Fan Page Updates, Hide Shared Photos, Hide Shared Links, Commented on \"This\", Liked \"This\", Facebook Memories, Your Memories (aka \"On this day\"), Shared Memories (Shared a memory), \"Is Live / Was Live\" (Facebook Live Video)\n\nYou can filter out any subject on Facebook that doesnt interest you, using the \"Text Filter\" function, for example say you were not interested in Politics, you could put the relevant keywords/phrases that get mentioned in Political posts, such as the names of the Political party members, the party names, etc into the Text Filter box, and FBP will filter out any posts from the Newsfeed including that text. You can also use the Text Filter to filter out any mention of celebrities you are not interested in hearing about, such as Kanye, The Kardashians, etc.\n\nF.B. Purity now also has an image content filter that lets you filter out images of cats, dogs, selfies, babies, memes, food, smoking and also lets you set your own custom image content filters.\n\nYou can also hide any of the links in the right hand column, such as: Events, Games and App Requests, Recommended Pages, Suggested Groups, People You May Know / Find More Friends, Get Connected, Pokes, Friend Requests, Birthdays, Chat, the News Ticker bar, Trending Topics / Trending Hashtags\n\nMore Features\n-----------------------\n* An option to Force facebook to sort newsfeed by \"Most Recent\"\n* An option to sort your notifications in the correct Chronological order\n* Hide all game and application posts, including \"Games your friends are playing\" and \"Games you may like\". It also gives you the option to whitelist application posts that you do want to see in your Newsfeed, so the app/game spam filter wont hide them.\n* Adds an easily accesible Block Application (\"BA\") link to every game/app post, so you can easily block games/apps from your news-stream and from getting your personal data.\n* The \"BA\" (Block Application) link now lets you block multiple applications with a single click. Theres also an option (Under the More Options heading), that lets you turn off the game / application message filtering if you want to see all the game and app stories.\n* Easily Choose what size font and what font you want to view Facebook in.\n* Custom CSS box, lets you add your own Custom CSS Rules to Facebook: (see https://css.fbpurity.com for more info)\n* Filters out game and application posts and other extraneous stories on profile pages\n* Hide offline friends in chat\n* Hide offline and mobile friends in chat\n* Hide the Sponsored Stories / Suggested Posts / Suggested Pages (aka Hide all adverts )\n* Hide Facebook Smileys / Emoticon graphics.\n* Hide all photos\n* Hide all videos\n* Hide Upcoming Events / Upcoming Concerts\n* Change Facebook's colours (font and background / theme) (Choose what color font and background you want, to customise the site to your liking)\n* Set a Background image\n* Hide links in left column, including App Center, Like Pages, Pages Feed, Games Feed, Events, Pokes, Music, Memories, Ad Center, Places Editor, Sale Groups, etc\n* Hide all the ads ( ad blocker / ad blocking / remove all adverts on facebook)\n* Hide Facebook reactions  bar / \"reacted to\" stories\n* Remove colored backgrounds from statuses\n* Auto expand the Explore and Shortcuts section in the left column\n* Auto Remove Recent Logins functionality\n* View Your list of Deactivated Friends\n\n\nIf you have any problems or questions about F.B.

    "description": "The SafeToOpen (safe to open) Online Security browser extension is like having an information security expert sitting next to you looking for indicators of a suspicious web page. SafeToOpen Online Security warns you if a web page is risky and reassures you if it is safe. \n \nWhat distinguishes SafeToOpen Online Security from other browser extensions, anti-viruses, and secure email gateways is the ability to detect never-before-seen or zero-day phishing web pages in real-time.

You can see the list of blocked domains on the options page. Moreover, you can edit this list to add or remove desired items.\n\nThe toolbar button serves as an ON|OFF switch. Badge icon color will also change to adapt itself to the new state. The red icon is when the addon is active and the Grey icon is for the inactive state. When you are browsing the internet, the addon constantly monitors websites for containing crypto-coin miming third-party domains. Once a URL is detected, it instantly blocks it from loading in your browser. This way, no website can use your computer resources to mine digital currencies.\n\nNote: to report bugs, please fill the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/block-miners.html).",

Most times this was done under high time pressure. Even if a project start was delayed, the fieldwork go-live date was never moved.\n\nFor testing was never enough time and so the QA team never was able to find all issues inside the surveys. The first two days of fieldwork were used to fix the late found issues and to change the survey due to customer change requests.\n\n \n\nSounds familiar?\n\n\nEven today, when talking to corporate Market Research departments or full-service Market Research specialists, it does not show a different picture. With the rise of mobile devices and a fragmented browser market, the situation is today even worse than ever. \"Traditional\" testing methods using Excel, Emails, and Screenshots are not sufficient enough for getting the best possible results and making the timelines​.

    "description": "UPDATE:\nBased on feedbacks in Reviews, I have added Prime-Only selection support in the extension!\n\nI am not happy when Amazon search results end up showing \"Featured\" product sort order by default. I am more interested in getting a sort order of my choice as default so I do not have to manually change it everytime I search for a product. Therefore, I ended up building this extension that automatically shows only the sort order that I want to see. \n\nSo, if you are like me and you want to set a default sort method instead of always clicking on the sort order and selecting \"Average Customer Reviews\" or \"Price: Low to High\", this extension is for you. It will save you a click and selecting the right sort order. There is also an OFF switch if you choose to go wild and opt for a different sort method without changing your default.\n\nThis is an early release. I will keep updating it every now and then. Please send me your honest critical feedback on harshankur@outlook.com. It will make me build a better product for a bigger set of audience.\n\nTHANK YOU!",

    "description": "This is a 1-Click Button extension that works with or without the URL Incrementer extension. If you have URL Incrementer installed, you'll be able to select the part of the URL to increment or decrement and all other options. If you don't have URL Incrementer installed, the button will simply try to increment or decrement the most likely number in the URL (usually the last number).\n\nMini FAQ\n\nQ: Do I need URL Incrementer installed to use this button?\nNope, not anymore (as of Version 5.9)! If you don't have URLI installed, the button will simply default to try to smartly increment or decrement the most likely number in the URL (usually the last number). If you need to choose a different part of the URL, then you would need to install the \"URL Incrementer\" extension and use it to setup the selection first.\n\nQ: I have URL Incrementer installed. Do I need this?\nNope! Think of this as only a convenient 1-click button for your toolbar.\n\nQ: Why is this a separate extension?\nExtensions are limited to only one toolbar icon. So, URL Incrementer can't offer you a 1-click button because of all the various buttons it needs to show you in its popup (Increment, Increment, Clear, and so on). The popup is also really annoying and closes easily if you click outside of it, and it also requires two clicks to perform an action.\n\nQ: Does this consume resources... am I going to regret installing this?\nYou won't! The background memory has been set to \"persistent\": false so the button consumes 0 Browser Memory when you're not using it.\n\nQ: How does it work with URL Incrementer?\nIt simply sends a message to URL Incrementer each time you click it to perform the action in 1 click. You can just click it and use it like a Quick Shortcut, or use URL Incrementer first to select the part of the URL to increment/decrement and the interval and other options, and all these settings will take effect when you click the button.\n\nPermissions Justification\nURL Decrement Button requires no special permissions.\n\nRemote Code Policy\nURL Decrement Button does *not* use any remote code. All code is included locally in the software package and goes under review before being published.\n\nPrivacy Policy\nURL Decrement Button does *not* track you. It does *not* use analytic services. It does *not* collect or transmit any data from your device or computer. All your data is stored locally on your device. Your data is *your* data.",

Once installed, an icon featuring the Office Spinner logo will appear in your browser, enabling you to request beverages from your colleagues who are also using the extension and connected to the same internet connection.\n\nThe app automatically adds everyone who has installed the extension to the participant list, allowing them to indicate whether they would like to receive a drink. Once everyone has responded, a roulette wheel will appear on all computers, randomly selecting the person who will have to fetch beverages for the group. The loser will receive a notification, and the app has additional tools such as the sit-stand desk feature to remind users to change their posture.\n\nOffice Spinner is a free app, but you can also sign up for a PLUS account to support the app's development, gain access to more statistics, and create groups. With a PLUS account, the app will also be ad-free.\n\nTo log in, you can use your LinkedIn, Google (including Workspace business accounts), Microsoft Account (including Office 365), or Twitter account, which will provide your first name. We plan to introduce other methods of identifying users in the future.\n\nIf you encounter any issues, discover errors, or have any great ideas, please contact us at sebastiaan@officespinner.com.

    "description": "Please refresh the page that needs to be translated after installation or update! ! !\n\nIntroduction\n\nWelcome to Edge Translate!\n\nEdge Translate is a simple and practical translation plugin that supports mainstream browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and 360 Secure Browser . The main purpose of our plugin is to assist users in reading foreign literature. To this end, we have followed the principle of the user's reading experience first, and made the following efforts:\n\n* Google Translate API\n\nWe use the API provided by Google Translate to translate words and sentences, which guarantees the accuracy of translation results to a certain extent;\n\n* PDF File Supported\n\nWe support the translation of wording in PDF files, which breaks the dyslexia of many users when reading PDF documents (due to the Firefox browser's bug, this feature is temporarily unavailable on Firefox browser);\n\n* Reading Friendly Result Displaying\n\nWe chose the friendly side pop-up to show the translation results. The pop-up display bar will push the user reading content to avoid blocking the content from affecting the reading;\n\n* Simple and Clear Look\n\nWe designed a simple and clear translation result display column, highlighting important content, and ensuring that the user's attention is focused on the content displayed rather than the insignificant things such as the display box;\n\n* Fix The Result Frame\n\nIf the frequency of the your translation is relatively high, you can choose to fix the display bar to avoid frequent pop-ups affecting reading.\n\n* Fully Customizable\n\nWe allow users to decide for themselves which content in the translation results they need to display. For example, if you just want to know the meaning of the word, you can choose to view only the common meaning of the word. If you also want to learn the specific usage of a word, we also provide the pronunciation, definition, detailed explanation, example sentence, etc. of the word in more detail. Content for you to view;\n\n* Efficient Shortcuts\n\nWe have provided a wealth of shortcut keys to make the operation efficiency greatly improved. Now you only need to use the keyboard to complete the translation of selected words, expand the search panel, fix and unpin the translation results;\n\n* Website Blacklist\n\nWe provide a useful blacklist feature that allows you to easily add a page you are browsing to a blacklist to disable wording translations and double-click translations on the page, or to remove the page being viewed from the blacklist to re-enable word translation and double click translation on this page.\n\n* Whole Page Translating\n\nWe support web page translation and can translate the entire web page directly into the language you need. And you are free to choose YouDao web page translation or Google web page translation to fully meet your translation needs.\n\nThe birth of Edge Translate is inseparable from the open source community. In the development process of Edge Translate, we used Mozilla's pdf.js as a built-in PDF reader to support word translation in PDF files. We refered to crimx's saladict for solutions of some problems. We also used gulp, webpack and other excellent open source tools to assist in development. And we would like to express our gratitude.\n\nWe are also grateful to users who have used Edge Translate since 0.2.0 and provided us with feedback. You have provided us with a lot of very good comments and suggestions. Without you, there may no be the current Edge Translate.\n\n* Instructions\nEdge Translate instructions : \n\nhttps://github.com/EdgeTranslate/EdgeTranslate/blob/master/docs/wiki/en/Instructions.md\n\n* Precautions\nEdge Translate precautions : \n\nhttps://github.com/EdgeTranslate/EdgeTranslate/blob/master/docs/wiki/en/Precautions.md\n\nQuestions and Feedback\nEdge Translate were developed by us ( nickyc975 and Mark Fenng ) in our spare time, and there are inevitably some problems. If you have any comments or suggestions, please feel free to give us feedback at the first time and help us to make it better.\n\nFeedback link：https://github.com/EdgeTranslate/EdgeTranslate/issues/new/choose\n\nEmail: nickyc975 : chenjinlong2016@outlook.com, Mark Fenng : f18846188605@gmail.com\n\nIn addition, developers are welcome to give us issues and pull requests. If you like this project, welcome to fork & star.",

    "description": "The KeePassHelper is a browser extension to provide the username and password access from the KeePass (https://keepass.info/), KeePassXC (https://keepassxc.org/), and MacPass (https://macpassapp.org/) applications within your browser. The extension adds an action button to your browser toolbar area. Pressing the button opens a panel that displays all the matching credentials for the current domain. You can ask the extension to insert the username, password, or both by pressing the action buttons. The extension also optionally submit the login form if you would like to. This extension offers a built-in OTP (One-time password) tool, so you don't need to have a separate plugin. \n\nThis extension supports the following applications:\n1. KeePass application with KeePassHttp installed\n2. KeePassXC with a custom manifest (uses native messaging to communicate)\n3. Direct read of KDBX3 or KDBX4 databases (when you cannot install a native application)\n4. Any other alternatives that support HTTP communication (such as MacPass)\n\nNotes:\n1. When using this extension, first make sure the login or password input box is focused on the page before opening the panel. Username and password filling occur if an input element is selected on a form.\n2. It is recommended to use the extensions manager of your browser to define a custom shortcut for this extension. This way you can fill the username and password fields without using your mouse. This extension supports keyboard shortcuts for almost all the actions.\n3. It is possible to generate one-time password tokens using this extension.\n4. This extension optionally supports automatic logins (this feature is not yet supported on manifest v3).\n4. This extension also supports native messaging communication for  KeePassXC. Go to the options page to configure the extension to work with KeePassXC.\n5. As of version 0.6.7, the extension supports reading the native string fields of KeePass for generating time-based passwords (\"TimeOtp-Secret-Base32\", \"TimeOtp-Period\" and \"TimeOtp-Length\" keys are supported)\n6. If you are not using the built-in OTP feature of the KeePass application, the OTP can optionally be stored in SHA-256 encryption. This is additional password protection for your secret keys.\n\nFAQs Page:\n  http://add0n.com/keepass-helper.html\nBug Reports:\n  https://github.com/belaviyo/keepass-macpass-helper/\nPrivacy Policy:\n  https://add0n.com/policies/unixeco.txt\n\nSetup to work with KeePass application:\nRequirements:\n1. KeePass 2 (http://keepass.info) --  version 2.17 or newer\n2. KeePassHttp (https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp/) --  download link is https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp/blob/master/KeePassHttp.plgx\n\nDirections:\n1) Install KeePass\n2) Install KeePassHttp plugin by dropping KeePassHttp.plgx into the KeePass Program Files directory\n2a) Restart and login to your KeePass application\n2b) Verify KeePassHttp has been installed correctly by checking Tools > Plugins\n3) Navigate to any page containing a password\n4) Click the toolbar button\n5) Switch to the KeePass window, enter a descriptive name into the dialog that popped up, and click the save button (the popup window of the KeePassHelper extension needs to be open during this process).\n6) Your passwords are now securely retrieved from KeePass and automatically entered into password forms and fields when needed.\n",

First performed on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personae to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways.\n",

    "description": "LibrusPro to rozszerzenie do Librusa - najpopularniejszego e-dziennika w Polsce - wprowadzające ciemny motyw, liczące średnie ocen, mimo ich wyłączenia przez Administratora Szkoły, wyświetlające procentową obecność/frekwencję z każdego przedmiotu, pozwalające na dodawanie własnych wydarzeń w terminarzu oraz dodające wiele usprawnień funkcjonalności i wyglądu Librusa.\n\n⭐️ 𝗖𝗜𝗘𝗠𝗡𝗬 𝗠𝗢𝗧𝗬𝗪! 🖤 \nW końcu Librus nie boli w oczy! :) JEDYNY taki na rynku dedykowany, dopracowany czarny motyw do tego e-dziennika!\n\n⭐️ Własne wydarzenia w terminarzu 📆\nChcesz dodać własne wydarzenie do swojego terminarza? Planowane kartkówki, odpowiedzi ustne, a może prace domowe, o których nie chcesz zapomnieć, a nie zostały wpisane przez nauczyciela? Z tym rozszerzeniem jest to wreszcie możliwe! Idealne na problemy z pamięcią.\n\n⭐️ Obliczanie średniej ocen 📈\nNiektóre szkoły wyłączają możliwość wyświetlania średniej ocen dla ich uczniów i rodziców. Na szczęście Twój komputer potrafi dodawać, mnożyć i dzielić, więc sobie sam poradzi :) W tabeli znajdziesz także odpowiednio średnią z całego semestru, z ocen proponowanych, ze śródrocznych, a także ze wszystkich ocen cząstkowych (średnia roczna).\n\n⭐️ Wyświetlanie procentowej frekwencji z przedmiotów 🎓\nZastanawiasz się ile masz procent frekwencji z danego przedmiotu? Może chcesz wiedzieć, ile jeszcze lekcji możesz opuścić, aby nadal być klasyfikowanym? Nie ma sprawy. W zakładce Frekwencja wystarczy, że naciśniesz odpowiedni przycisk, a Twoje procenty obecności magicznie się pojawią.\n\n⭐️ Ukrywanie przedmiotów bez ocen 🚫\nPo co w ogóle mają się wyświetlać, skoro przez cały rok nie dostaniesz z nich ani jednej oceny?\n\n⭐️ Wyświetlanie numerka z dziennika i \"Szczęśliwy Numerek\" 🔢\nNie możesz nigdy zapamiętać, który masz numerek w dzienniku? Od teraz będzie zawsze widniał na górze strony obok \"Szczęśliwego Numerka\", abyś go już nigdy nie zapomniał(a). Jeśli w Twojej szkole jest włączona opcja jego losowania, to już nigdy nie przegapisz tego, kiedy będzie nim Twój!\n\n⭐️ Modernizacja terminarza 📅\nPo co najeżdżać na każdą rzecz w terminarzu, aby przeczytać jej opis? Od teraz znajdziesz wszystko na wierzchu, bez konieczności najeżdżania! Wygoda ponad wszystko. Możesz także wyłączyć wyświetlanie swojej klasy pod każdym zdarzeniem, a także skorzystać z trybu modernizacji terminarza, który sprawia go trochę bardziej czytelnym i odchudzonym.\nJeśli Twoja szkoła udostępniła plan lekcji, to będziesz go również widzieć po najechaniu na symbol '≡' znajdujący się w kafelkach.\n(Zajrzyj do opcji rozszerzenia, aby włączyć/wyłączyć poszczególne funkcje)\n\n⭐️ Modernizacja dymków 📢\nDymki z dodatkowymi informacjami, które pojawiają się po najechaniu na oceny, nieobecności, bądź wydarzenia w terminarzu, od teraz nabierają nowych barw i wyglądają choć trochę lepiej, niż szare mury szkoły, do której uczęszczasz.\n\n⭐️ Tymczasowa modyfikacja ocen i kalkulator jedynek 📝\nGdy włączysz to ustawienie w widoku ocen, będziesz mógł(a) tymczasowo, lokalnie dodawać nowe oceny, bądź edytować i usuwać bieżące, aby sprawdzić jaką miał(a)byś wtedy średnią.\n(Po odświeżeniu strony wszystko wróci do stanu sprzed modyfikacji! Zmiany zachodzą jedynie lokalnie i nie mają wpływu na Twoje rzeczywiste oceny!)\nMożesz zobaczyć także ile jedynek możesz jeszcze dostać, aby nadal znajdować się powyżej danej średniej, w menu dodawania nowych ocen cząstkowych.\n\n⭐️ Wersja depresyjna 🕶\nStonowane kolory ocen i wydarzeń w terminarzu, gdy nie czujesz się najlepiej. Wersja możliwa do włączenia w opcjach rozszerzenia.\n\n⭐️ Wyłączenie mrugania zagrożeń 🚨\nNauczyciel postanowił Cię zagrozić i teraz cały rok mruga Ci jedynka? Spokojnie, załatwione. Już nie mruga.\n\n⭐️ Zapobieganie automatycznemu wylogowaniu 🎉\nDopóki karta z e-dziennikiem będzie otwarta, Twoja sesja nie wygaśnie! Koniec nieprzyjemnych komunikatów \"🛑 STOP 🛑\".\n\n⭐️ Poprawki oraz dodatki wizualne 🔨\n  ► możliwość wyłączenia wyświetlania jedynek w menu rozszerzenia,\n  ► wyświetlanie proponowanego zachowania w tabeli głównej,\n  ► wyeksponowanie nowych (i oddanych) prac domowych oraz wiadomości,\n  ► usunięcie przycisku Wersja Alternatywna, kto normalny z tego korzysta...,\n  ► usunięcie przycisku Bezpieczny Uczeń w szkołach, w których jest on włączony,\n  ► przeniesienie w zamian przycisku Plan lekcji, który otwiera go w nowej karcie, a nie oknie,\n  ► otwieranie podglądów prac domowych również w nowej karcie, a nie oknie,\n  ► poświetlenie średniej rocznej kwalifikującej się na czerwony pasek,\n  ► wyświetlanie daty dodania oceny w widoku jej szczegółów (po kliknięciu),\n  ► możliwość wyłączenia wyświetlania ocen i frekwencji z I semestru,\n  ► wyświetlanie danych osobowych po kliknięciu na pole \"jesteś zalogowany(-a) jako:\",\n  ► zaciemnianie przeszłych oraz wolnych dni w terminarzu,\n  ► oraz wiele innych pomniejszych zmian i smaczków!\n\n👑 Z rozszerzeniem LibrusPro, to Ty stajesz się władcą tego e-dziennika. Nie przegap takiej okazji!\n\n📢 Jeżeli masz jakąś propozycję, bądź znalazłeś(-aś) jakiś błąd, dołącz na oficjalnego Discorda: https://discord.gg/e9EkVEvsDr\n\n👋 Jeżeli rozszerzenie Ci się spodobało, nie zapomnij polecić znajomym, niech korzystanie z Librusa stanie się choć trochę przyjemniejsze dla nas wszystkich.\n\n(っ◔◡◔)っ \" Ｕｌｅｐｓｚ　Ｌｉｂｒｕｓａ　ｊｕż　ｄｚｉś！\"",

    "description": "Rate articles, improve the web.\n\nThis plugin will help to fight fake news and will give content a quality score and authors across the web a reputation. As such, authors can be held accountable for whatever news they will be spreading in a way that is fair, open while warranting the privacy of these authors and their commenters. \n\nThrough a detailed analysis of both AI and real-time reader feedback, articles across the web can be rated, based on their quality, fake news probability and the likelihood of plagiarism. Thanks to your ratings, we can build an IMDb for articles, benefitting all internet users. As a thank you for your work, we will reward you with FLOQ Tokens. This tokenised approach will warrant active engagement. Authors that publish articles on Datafloq will also receive tokens depending on the quality of their article and their reputation. At this moment, the tokens are not yet worth anything, but once we have launched Mavin.org users can exchange their FLOQ tokens for MVN crypto tokens.\n\nDatafloq also offers a new search engine. This will allow users to find articles, or authors, based on quality, reputation, fake news probability or plagiarism probability — a novelty for the web.\n\nFor more information see: https://datafloq.com/plugin/faq",

Fine-grained analysis allows you to explore your social network, diversify it, or - if you prefer - dig deeper into your bubble. Crossfoam thus becomes a tool for electronic self-determination.\n\nIn order to enable this experience, Crossfoam allows you to select your own social media account (or some else’s) and download this account’s network onto your local computer. Then a network analysis is performed, which tries to identify clusters within your network (bubbles). You can then use the build-in visualisation system or download the data to use in another application.\n\nCrossfoam is build privacy first.

Icons made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com.\n\nAdds a customizable list of projects so you can easily start/stop timing your work. Uses the standard Redmine time tracking features.\n\nThis tool gives you a few handy features to help track time in Redmine.\n\n*A button in your browser to start/stop time tracking*\nIf you're on a Redmine issue page when you start tracking, it tracks time for the issue. If you're inside a project page (but not inside an issue), it tracks time to the project. You can also use a keyboard shortcut (Alt + R) to start/stop timing.\n\n*A page full of your projects*\nSome people don't always work on Redmine issues (like account managers) -- they need an easy way to jump from project to project and track time. Right-click anywhere on any page and choose \"Show Redmine Timer Buttons\" from the context menu.\n\nWhen you open the list, you'll see a touch-friendly list of those projects. I move this window onto my laptop screen (as opposed to my main external monitor) so I can simply touch the one I want to time.\n\n*Bugs*\nInstead of leaving a bad review, which will crush my soul, please add bug reports here: https://bitbucket.org/jprc8/redmine-timer-for-browsers/issues.\n\n*Notes*\nMy company uses this extension and it hasn't set anything on fire yet. That said, there is ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY expressed nor implied. Use at your own risk. Don't call me if it somehow doesn't work, deletes all of Redmine, terrorizes your cat, etc.\n\n*Additional Credits*\nIcons made by Freepik from http://www.flaticon.com.

    "description": "Overview\n\nTalking clock provides time reminder and custom reminder functions, suitable for time and periodic task reminders in daily work and life. It can also display date and time.\nReminder methods include voice announcement and system notifications.\n\nThis extension is especially suitable for people who often work for a long time with desktop computer, such as writers, programmers, and people who work remotely or indoors.\n• Time reminder helps to manage the time while focusing on the work.\n• Custom reminders are suitable for periodic daily affairs, such as \"Remind me to have lunch at 11:30 every day\".\n\n1. Time Reminder\nIt announces the time periodically by voice engine and/or system notification. \n\nThe time interval can be set in the options of the extension:\n5 minutes / 10 minutes / 15 minutes / 20 minutes / 30 minutes / 1 hour / 2 hours / 3 hours.\n\nIn addition, there are several DnD(do not disturb) settings which enabled by default, such as don't remind me time if the browser is in full screen or playing video.\n\n2. Custom Reminder\nUsers can add custom reminders. Supported reminder types include:\n• Only once: only reminds on a specific date.\n• Daily reminder: reminder at one or more time every day.\n• Weekly reminder: choose one or more days from Monday to Sunday.\n• Monthly reminder: choose one or more days from the 1st day to the last day every month.\n• Annual reminder: choose one or more days every year, such as \"Birthday reminder\".\n\nAll types can set one or more reminder time on the reminder day. In this way, on the one hand, it can meet the needs of multiple reminders in one day for one thing. For example, \"Remind me to take medicine three times (in the morning, noon and evening) every day\", just create a daily reminder, which sets three reminder time. On the other hand, multiple reminder time can be set for important things to avoid missing it.\n\n3. Clock\nThe popup page displays current time and date by clicking the extension icon. In addition, the extension icon itself can also display the time (not enabled by default).\n\nIn the options for clock settings, you can set:\n• Display analog clock or digital clock.\n• Whether to display seconds.\n• Whether to display the date.\n• Whether to display the time on the extension icon.\n\n4. Other\nIn the extensions keyboard shortcuts settings(edge://extensions/shortcuts), you can set shortcuts for displaying the time and announcing the time.\n\n\nAbout Reminder Methods\nYou can use one or both of two reminder methods:\n• Voice announcement: announce the time or custom content by Text-to-Speech engine.\n• System notification: send a desktop notification.\n\nThe voice announcement will make a sound, so it may not be suitable for everyone. In addition, if you forget to turn on the speaker or the volume is too low, you will not hear it.\n\nSystem notification may also be missed if it disappears automatically. So:\n• System notification for time reminder will automatically disappear after a few seconds, because it's not very important.\n• Custom reminders are more important than time reminder. So to prevent missing it, system notification for custom reminders will disappear automatically after one minute by default, not a few seconds. You can set this behavior for each custom reminder separately.\n\nIn summary, voice announcements and system notifications can complement each other to avoid missing reminder.\n\n\nAbout Text-to-Speech (TTS)\nTTS includes the TTS provided by the operating system and the remote TTS provided by the browser. The former can be adjusted in the operating system settings, while the latter depends on the network connection. The operating system comes with a general voice effect, it is available offline; the voice provided by the browser is usually better, but it requires network connection.\n\nTTS is used by time reminder and custom reminders. In the extension options, you can set TTS voice. Each voice usually only supports text in one language, and may not read text correctly in other languages.\n\n\nHow to open extension options?\n• Right-click the extension icon, then click Options.\n• Click the extension icon, move the mouse to the popup page, then click the setting icon in the upper right corner.\n\n\nThis extension is not an alarm clock\nIt is suitable for daily affairs, but it is not an alarm clock. For example, if you want to catch a plane or get up early, please do not rely on this extension. Because the extension cannot issue a reminder when you exit the browser or when the computer goes into sleep. So it is not suitable for very important things.\n\nNote: due to a browser restriction, reminders/notifications may be delayed for a little time (less than 1 minute).",

    "description": "Simple and seamless privacy protection for your browser.  \n\nProtecting your privacy online is like protecting your home. Locking the front door won’t stop the most determined folks from getting inside, especially if you’ve left the back door and windows unlocked and an extra key under the doormat. That’s why we offer multiple types of privacy protection, most of which aren’t offered in most popular browsers by default.   \n\nWith the press of a button, you get seamless protection from most 3rd-party trackers while you search and browse, access to tracking protections for emails you receive, and much more. Together these privacy essentials make more privacy your default.  \n \nFEATURE HIGHLIGHTS \n\n• Search Privately by Default - DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in, so you can easily search the web without being tracked. \n\n• Escape Website Trackers Before They Load - automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using (e.g. sale, ads, etc.) any data from these trackers. Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology goes well above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default. \n\n• Automatically Enforce Encryption - force many sites you visit to automatically use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, which helps shield your data from Wi-Fi snoopers and network onlookers like your Internet provider. Most popular browsers only direct users to encrypted versions of pages in specific circumstances, like when you navigate directly to a page in the address bar. We check our list of upgradable sites for all links you click. \n\n• Enable Built-in Email Protection - Over 85% of emails sent to Duck Addresses contained trackers that can detect when you’ve opened a message, where you were when you opened it, and what device you were using. Email Protection makes it easy to block most email trackers and hide your existing address when signing up for things online, all without switching email providers. \n\n• Escape Fingerprinting — helps stop companies from creating a unique identifier for you by blocking their attempts to combine specific information about your browser and device settings.  \n\n• Block Tracking Cookies — prevents most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site. \n \nADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS NOT AVAILABLE ON MOST BROWSERS \n\n• Link Tracking Protection — helps stop companies from gathering your browsing history and other information via personal identifiers embedded in the links you click on.  \n\n• Embedded Social Content Tracking Protection — blocks embedded Facebook content around the web so they can't track you through their videos, posts, and comments found on other sites. You can easily unblock to view them if desired.  \n\n• Google AMP Protection — forces sites to load content directly from publishers instead of using Google-owned links, which are full of creepy trackers.   \n\n• Signal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC) — built-into our app, GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction. \n\nNote about our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection following DuckDuckGo ad clicks: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Protection goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default, but we’re constantly working to make it more comprehensive. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.   \n\nRead more about this and our Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/privacy/web-tracking-protections/  \n\nYou don't need to wait to take back your privacy.

    "description": "How do you know when you’re really on the Microsoft365 website? MetaCert tells you.\n\nProtects you from known malware and phishing. This browser extension tells you which links inside are safe, dangerous and unknown. If a link is “unknown”, you should proceed with caution. The URL reputation system built into the software tells you when sign in pages and websites are verified as safe.\n\nMetaCert is the only software that can protect you from *new* dangerous links and websites that evade other security companies that haven’t had time to validate them yet.\n\nMillions of new domains are registered by cybercriminals every year. It’s mathematically impossible for any security company in the world to protect you from them all. That’s why we decided to do things different at MetaCert. \n\n1 minute to install / no setup. \n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\n\n- Red Warning = Danger\n- Green Shield = Verified\n- Grey Shield = Caution\n\nWhenever you open a link, this extension will immediately check it against the MetaCert authentication system. Dangerous links/websites are immediately blocked before harm can be done. And authenticated websites display the MetaCert green shield.\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nBefore signing into Microsoft365, the reputation shield will turn green. If the shield doesn’t turn green, you know it’s a new counterfeit website that hasn’t been validated yet. This is the magic that will keep you safe.\n\nWHY WEBSITE AUTHENTICATION?\n\nOver 93% of all new phishing websites start with https and display the browser padlock. It’s time to replace the padlock with the reputation shield for online trust.\n\nFREE TRIAL\n\nYou can try the software for free for 14 days. No credit card needed. And if you sign up, you can cancel your subscription at anytime. We also offer a 30 day money back guarantee.\n\nMost security products that are free, collect and sell your data. We think that’s creepy. That’s why ours is a paid service. Pricing here: https://metacert.com/pricing.html\n\nABOUT THE TEAM\n\nMetaCert is brought to you by the same developers who built the official browser extensions for digg, Delicious, Yahoo!, Nike, Sony, eBay, PayPal, Google and Microsoft. We build software that’s fast, secure and reliable.\n\nFounder and CEO Paul Walsh is one of the two people who co-instigated the creation of the standard for URL Classification at the W3C, the standard body for the World Wide Web - formally replacing PICS in 2009.",

    "description": "Want to find the real time price of Ethereum? Just install our software extension today!\n\nInstall our Ethereum Price tracker today and see the historical prices of ethereum.\n\nHow do I get Ethereum?\nThere are two methods to get ethereum, the first method is to buy it online from a ethereum exchange. The second method is to try and mine for ethereum yourself.\n\nHow do I store my ethereum?\nEthereum can be stored by yourself vs online on other ethereum providers. There have been many prominent hacks of online ethereum providers before and it is not easy to choose between whether to trust a third party vs yourself. If you store it by yourself, you can do so via a USB drive etc.\n\nWhat happens if I lose my ethereum password?\nYou are out of luck if you lose your ethereum password. The lack of a central authority makes it impossible for you to get access to your ethereum again unless you have your password.\n\nIf you are interested in finding the price history of ethereum, just install our extension today.\n\nEthereum was meant to be used as a way to enforce contracts in a low cost and efficient manner. For example, ethereum can be used to replace the function of Kickstarter, as each individual can pledge their ethereum. This ethereum is held and not given to the project owner until the target is met. Hence, the 10% which is given to Kickstarter is saved and the transaction costs involved in pledging for a new product becomes a lot lower using ethereum vs the traditional method.\n",

On these pages, you will have all the time you need.  Just set those websites as \"Allowed Websites\" in the options.  Certain sites such as Facebook and Youtube should be set as \"Blocked Websites\" in the options.  All other websites receive a countdown timer where you must get the information you need before time runs out and the owl closes the page.  \n\nThe owl is very strict.  He will berate and mock you.  You'll be forced to complete tasks to earn break time.  If you do consistent work, use the timeboxing scheduler for work/vacation, and complete the owl's psychological exercises then you might be able to earn the owl's respect.  In version 1.0 no matter what you tried the owl's respect score would not increase.  Now it is technically possible to earn the owl's respect - but highly unlikely. ",

    "description": "IRIS Invigilation (IRIS) helps provide educators assurance of assessment integrity during online and remote assessment.\n\nWhat is IRIS?\nIRIS Invigilation (IRIS) is a software program that helps provide educators assurance of assessment integrity during online and remote assessment. IRIS records audio, video, and computer screen activity for the duration of a test/exam. It analyses this information using machine learning and automatically flags potential academic dishonesty through displaying the data in an easy to use reporting dashboard. \n\nHow does IRIS work? \nIRIS records video of a student's face throughout their proctored exam tracking head and eye movement. IRIS records the audio from the student computer’s microphone video from their webcam and takes successive screenshots of what the student is seeing on their computer screen. Facial markers are identified and tracked; categorising and distinguishing innocent behaviours from dishonest behaviours. Educators can then review this data at a time that is convenient to help ensure student identity verification and assessment integrity. \n\nIs it safe for students to share their data? \nIRIS Invigilation software is a safe, secure and necessary method of maintaining academic integrity at a university/institute. The proctoring/invigilation of online assessments is necessary when conducting online learning to ensure educational standards are maintained and to avoid academic dishonesty. Students that share their data are helping to protect the quality and reputation of their institution.   \n\nThe privacy and protection of students and their personal information is paramount. IRIS ensures that data security, protection laws, privacy legislation and regulation are their priority. IRIS uses AWS Cloud Security to protect data and host all data in Sydney, Australia. IRIS does not sell or use any student assessment data; only IRIS technical administrators have access to this for maintenance and security purposes. \n\nIRIS Security Infrastructure: \n•    Two-factor authentication is enabled for the cloud services account that hosts IRIS \n•    Strict firewall schemes protect all IRIS related services to protect user data and prevent nefarious access to the IRIS infrastructure \n•    Only ports and services that need to communicate with each other and to the outside world will be kept open.  These ports/services have strict IP security groups for inbound and outbound traffic \n•    IRIS will never share or sell your personal data to a third party. \n•    Microsoft Edge will ask your permission before installing the IRIS extension on your computer.  \n•    IRIS will only invigilate you during your exam. The permissions you agree to are only for the exam duration.  \n\nPrivacy Policy \nIRIS invigilation values the privacy of its users and is committed to handling their data responsibly and securely. We will never sell any collected data to external parties. All recordings and personal information are solely used for invigilation purposes. All staff and contractors working under IRIS invigilation must comply with Australia’s Privacy Act and this policy. This policy explains how IRIS Invigilation gathers, manages, stores and discards all of the recordings and personal information through our browser extension and website. \n\nInformation we Collect\nUser information request prior to start of invigilation: When the extension is triggered upon accessing the online exam, the student will be required to enter details such as full name and student ID. This is for the assessor to be able to identify if the correct student is sitting for the examination only. Microphone and webcam permissions are requested by the extension at this initial state for the invigilation to be fully performed, which is processed on our servers to catch any suspicious activities and can be reviewed by the assessors. \nA photo of the student’s ID is also taken at the next step. The photo is used to match against the person who is shown on the webcam to make sure no other person is sitting the exam in place of the student. \nAs the invigilation commences, the extension will request to share the student’s screen, which it will start capturing. Throughout the online exam, the audio, webcam and screen will be recorded in accordance to the client institution’s examination regulations and uploaded to IRIS Invigilation’s AWS servers for processing and review. \nLog Data is also captured while the extension is running. Information such as IP address, which web browser and which version, timestamp and which errors have been encountered during the interaction. These details are only used for troubleshooting and maintenance purposes. \nOther hosting regions for data are available for a client upon request, but by default all data is stored and processed in Sydney, Australia. \n\nData Retention \nAll the student recordings are kept on the IRIS Invigilation storage servers for 1 year. Following this period, the client institution can decide to keep copies of the data for safe keeping. IRIS Invigilation will not be held responsible for any mishandling of the data once the recordings are collected by the institute. \n\nSecurity \nEnterprise grade security measures are in place to make sure the IRIS Invigilation servers are protected against data theft or accidental loss. All outgoing and incoming data is made via encrypted (HTTPS) protocol. Firewall and IPS protection have been implemented to prevent attacks, and root access to the servers are only permitted via AWS security groups. \nMonitoring applications keeps logs on any suspicious activities and administrators are notified immediately once detected. \nDaily snapshots of the servers are facilitated for disaster recoveries or any accidental deletion of data.  \n\nContact Information \nIf you have any issues or queries regarding this privacy policy, then please contact us by the information below. \ninfo@irisinvigilation.com \n1300 138 522 \n1031 Wellington St, West Perth WA 6005",

It runs only while InPrivate browsing and so doesn't disrupt everyday browsing, but when you really need to bookmark your surprise party plans, et cetera, you can do so easily from the address bar. The next time you're InPrivate browsing, it's then really easy to bring up pages you've bookmarked in the past. You can also easily make multiple sets of bookmarks by choosing a different password for each set.\n\nWe've placed a heavy emphasis on security. Your bookmarks are encrypted using the highest standards before they're stored, so any would-be snoopers will never be able to see what you're actually planning.\n\n--\n\nThanks for checking us out!

No academic degree is required — a walk in the park. \n\nWhitelist any website you wish\nControl your browsing experience: whitelist pages or whole websites when needed, blacklist them again — it’s up to you.\n\nSpeed up page loading time\nAdLock not only removes ads but also gets rid of their placeholders. The web pages look nice and clean, with no empty boxes. Moreover, with AdLock, page loading speed is faster and your overall browsing experience is much smoother. \n\n\nAdLock was designed by users for users.

Feel free to contact us via support@adlock.com and share your thoughts and ideas.\n\n\nImportant!\n\nThe AdLock extension requires such permissions as:\n\n - \"Access data for all websites\": in order to make our product fully functional for your protection from ads.\n - \"Access to browser tabs\" to get information about the website you visit (website url, tab id, parent tab id). It allows us to block annoying ad requests, get rid of ad images and hide empty blocks with special cosmetic and net rules.\n - “Web navigation”: extension watches tab changes and reacts to keep webpage clean from ads.\n\nThe AdLock extension gathers anonymous usage information including browser language, a number of blocked ad requests, stores it on your local storage and doesn’t sell or share it with third parties. The AdLock extension also creates a unique ID and anonymously assigns to each installation. This ID is stored on the AdLock server until you uninstall the AdLock extension.\n",

Generally credible sites get a “Green” rating, meaning they adhere to basic standards of accuracy and transparency. Sites that publish health misinformation such as unproven treatments or bogus medical studies are flagged with a “Red” rating, meaning you should read them with a grain of salt.\n \nEven if you find information on health sites that HealthGuard has identified as generally trustworthy, it’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor about any issues, rather than trusting information you find online. Even accurate information may apply differently to different patients, and there’s no substitute for years of medical training and expertise. The internet should not be your doctor, and neither is HealthGuard.\n \nInstead, think of HealthGuard as a trusty sidekick to keep you away from untrustworthy health advice, and to point you toward more trustworthy sources, as you browse the web. \n \nHealthGuard is for personal use only.

Note that still, your extensions can use the internet. So let's say you have a web-based email client and an email notifier extension. The web-based one is disconnected, but the extension one is connected!\n\nNotes:\n1. You can enable and disable the offline mode right from the toolbar button. This is a toggle button.\n2. If you have open tabs, those tabs cannot send and receive network requests in the offline mode\n3. You can still browse local HTML files while you are in the offline mode, though these pages cannot anything to any web servers\n4. This extension dispatches \"online\" and \"offline\" events when the status changes and also sets \"navigator.onLine\" property accordingly.\n5. As of version 0.1.4, this extension blocks both HTTP and WebSocket traffics on the offline mode\n",

This extension gives you show all of switch roles from a browse menu by loading your aws configuration.\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Simple Configuration\nThe simplest configuration is for multiple **target roles** when you always intend to show the whole list.  **Target roles** can be expressed with a `role_arn` or with both `aws_account_id` and `role_name`.\n\n#### Optional parameters\n\n* `color` - The RGB hex value (without the prefix '#') for the color of the header bottom border and around the current profile.\n* `region` - Changing the region whenever switching the role if this parameter is specified.\n* `image` - The uri of an image to use on top of any color attribute supplied. The color and image are not mutually exclusive.\n\n```\n[profile marketingadmin]\nrole_arn = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/marketingadmin\ncolor = ffaaee\n\n[anotheraccount]\naws_account_id = 987654321987\nrole_name = anotherrole\nregion=ap-northeast-1\n\n[athirdaccount]\naws_account_id = 987654321988\nrole_name = athirdrole\nimage = \"https://via.placeholder.com/150\"\n```\n\n### Complex Configuration\nMore complex configurations involve multiple AWS accounts and/or organizations.\n\n- A profile that has only `aws_account_id` (without a `role_name`) is defined as **base account**.\n\n- **If your account is aliased, the alias will be shown in the role dropdown after 'Account:'.  You MUST use that alias as the aws_account_id for the base account instead of the numerical account id or your configuration won't work as expected.**\n\n- A **target role** is associated with a **base account** by the **target role** specifying a `source_profile`.\n\n- As above, **target roles** can be expressed with a `role_arn` or with both `aws_account_id` and `role_name` and can optionally pass the optional parameters.\n\n- If `target_role_name` is set in **base account**, the value is provided as the default role name for each **target roles**.\n\n```\n[organization1]\naws_account_id = your-account-alias\n\n[Org1-Account1-Role1]\nrole_arn = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/Role1\nsource_profile = organization1\n\n[Org1-Account1-Role2]\naws_account_id = 123456789012\nrole_name = Role2\nsource_profile = organization1\n\n[Org1-Account2-Role1]\naws_account_id = 210987654321\nrole_name = Role1\nsource_profile = organization1\n\n[baseaccount2]\naws_account_id = 000000000000\n\n[Base2-Role1]\nrole_arn = arn:aws:iam::234567890123:role/Role1\nsource_profile = baseaccount2\n\n[AnotherRole]\nrole_name = SomeOtherRole\naws_account_id = account-3-alias\n\n;\n; target_role_name example\n;\n[Org2-BaseAccount]\naws_account_id = 222200000000\ntarget_role_name = Developer\n\n[Org2-Account1-Developer]\naws_account_id = 222200001111\nsource_profile = Org2-BaseAccount\n\n[Org2-Account2-Manager]\naws_account_id = 222200002222\nrole_name = Manager ; overrides target role name\nsource_profile = Org2-BaseAccount\n```\n\nIf you sign-in a base account, target roles of the other base accounts are excluded.\n\nFor more information, please visit the homepage.",

    "description": "This extension only works on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS at this moment. \n\nA powerful clipboard manager with a searchable database that can store hundreds of items without any performance drawbacks. This extension has a very simple native component written in c++ that monitors clipboard changes system-wide and notifies the extension about the changes. This way first the extension can monitor clipboard without polling (continuous check with fixed interval) and second it can get notified even if clipboard content is changed by a process out of your browser environment. \n\nNotes:\n1. Each clipboard content can be up to 1Mbytes in size\n2. Each item is being indexed, so it can be searched later. The searching system is very powerful that supports wildcard matching and search operators like \"OR\" and \"AND\"\n3. Each clipboard entry can be pinned to prevent the auto clean-up module from removing it if the total number of clipboards reaches 1000 items.\n4. To search among pinned items append \"keyword:pinned\" to your search query\n5. To move an entry from the UI to the clipboard, press the Enter key or double-click on the entry.\n6. At this point, the extension does not support the automatic insertion of the clipboard content (the c++ component does not support it at this moment)\n7. The c++ component is compiled with https://travis-ci.org/lunu-bounir/clipboard-helper\n8. This extension is meant to replace the need to use native clipboard managers\n9. At this point, only Windows and Mac operating systems are supported. If you can help with the Linux port, please open a GitHub bug report\n10. The extension supports query stemming in 20 languages.\n",

This theme changes the look and feel of your browser and the new tab page to create a beautiful and immersive visual experience inspired by the game. You can also apply different themes to each profile to help you easily separate home, school, or work.\n\n10,000 kilometers in diameter, the Halo rings are immense weapons capable of scouring the galaxy clean of intelligent life. They were fabricated by the long-vanished Forerunners, a species that built worlds, disassembled stars … and was powerless in the face of a parasitic organism known as the Flood. \n\nNow it is up to the Master Chief to ensure they do not fall into the hands of the merciless alien Covenant.\n\nWhether you're a long-time fan or meeting the legendary Spartan super-soldier for the first time, The Master Chief Collection is the definitive Halo gaming experience.\n\nFeaturing Halo: Reach, Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2: Anniversary, Halo 3, Halo 3: ODST, and Halo 4, The Master Chief Collection offers players their own exciting journey through the epic saga. Starting with the incredible bravery of Noble Six in Halo: Reach and ending with the rise of a new enemy in Halo 4, the Master Chief’s story totals 67 campaign missions over six critically-acclaimed titles.\n\nLearn more about Halo: The Master Chief Collection: https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection/windows",

Everything you now type will search through the included indices of the AWS API documentation, although you can also search for aws-cli documentation by prefixing your query with the `@`-sign and through the AWS CloudFormation documentation by prefixing your query with the `:`-sign.\n\nYou can find detailed information in the official README on GitHub: https://github.com/pitkley/aws-search-extension.\n\nAutomatic/manual search-index updates\n=================================\n\nThe AWS search extension uses pre-built indices to provide fast search results without having to perform any network requests. By default the extension will update the indices automatically, at most once a day.\n\nYou can disable automatic index updates by clicking on the AWS search extension icon in your browser's extension area and deactivating the \"Enable automatic index updates\" option.\n\nYou can also update the used search-indices by activating the AWS search extension, typing \"!update\" and hitting Enter. The latest indices are then downloaded and imported automatically, within a few seconds.\n\nPrivacy\n=================================\n\nThe AWS search extension computes all search-suggestions locally and never sends your queries, or any other data, to any external server! Please note that it does retrieve the indices supporting the local search-suggestions by default once per day (given you perform a search). If you are not comfortable with this, you can opt out of automatic index updates in the extension's configuration, see below for more information.\n\nPlease note that the extension can not guarantee that your browser doesn't collect any data for the queries you enter into its omnibox.",

It's also possible to redirect navigation from one specific website to another. \n\nFAQs Page:\nhttps://add0n.com/block-site.html\n\nFeatures:\n1. Block unwanted domains. \n2. Prevent access to a range of websites using wildcard matching or regular expression matching.\n3. Reverse mode allows access to only some hostnames and blocks access to all others. \n4. Custom redirection; you can redirect a single blocked hostname to a new destination. \n5. Display a custom message on blocked pages.\n6. Time and date based blocking. Only block access to the websites at specified times and dates. This feature can be configured per hostname. \n7. Protect data leakage. This extension prevents certain hostnames from gathering network activity from your computer, since blocking occurs before any network request is emitted to the server.\n8. Auto-closes blocked tabs after a period of time.\n10. Closes annoying pop-ups as soon as the opening request is received.\n11. Pause and resume blocking from the right-click context menu of the toolbar button.\n12.

    "description": "Protect your email communication with end-to-end encryption (PGP). The secure envelope for emails, attachments and files (GDPR).\n\nMailvelope adds additional controls for secure end-to-end email encryption to your webmail client. Thus Mailvelope makes secure email with PGP easy and convenient - also for technical non-experts. Email attachments can be encrypted with just a few clicks.\n\nSecure sending and receiving of emails is not limited to Mailvelope users. By using open standards, Mailvelope is compatible with all other PGP software. A simple setup process leads you directly to the generation of your own PGP key and automatically stores the public part on the Mailvelope key server. From now on, any other Mailvelope user (and many others) can reach you easily and securely without having to exchange the key beforehand.\n\n- Mailvelope offers consistent end-to-end encryption. All operations necessary for encryption and decryption are conducted on your end device. Therefore even the respective webmail provider will never see your messages in plain text.\n\n- The European GDPR demands strict data protection standards for sending personal information for commercial services. With Mailvelope you can easily comply with these requirements.\n\n- Since Mailvelope is compatible with almost all webmail providers, you don't have to change your email address to be able to communicate easily and securely.\nServices like Nextcloud, as well as the email backends of many cloud solutions (Bitrix24, Zoho, etc.) are compatible with Mailvelope and can be activated with a simple click.\n\n- Mailvelope works out of the box with all common webmail providers:\n\n  Gmail\n  GMX\n  WEB.DE\n  Posteo\n  freenet Mail\n  Outlook.com\n  mailbox.org\n  Yahoo!\n\n  Many other email providers and web applications can be easily activated with a single click. Further information can be found at https://www.mailvelope.com/faq\n\nTechnical background\n\n- Mailvelope is Open Source and based on OpenPGP.js (https://openpgpjs.org), an OpenPGP library for JavaScript. The OpenPGP standard (based on PGP, as originally developed by Phil Zimmermann) uses a combination of strong public-key and symmetric encryption to secure electronic communication.\n\n- Thanks to OpenPGP standard compatible with GPG4Win, GPGTools, Enigmail for Thunderbird, Protonmail, OpenKeyChain and many more.\n\n- For both encryption and decryption, Mailvelope does not need the help of a server. Since all encryption operations are performed on your end device, your private key never leaves your end device, as is the case with many popular PGP cloud solutions.\nMailvelope uses a secure editor for entering and displaying your messages which is displayed in a separate browser window. Your email provider will never have access to the plain text of your messages.\n\n- In the years since 2013, Mailvelope has undergone several extensive security audits. A list can be found here: https://github.com/mailvelope/mailvelope/wiki/Security\n\n- For the attack scenario known as \"Efail\" in 2018, Mailvelope proved to be largely resistant. (See: https://www.mailvelope.com/en/blog/implications-efail-on-mailvelope)\n\n- Since Mailvelope is open source software, the source code is open for inspection. This ensures that Mailvelope only does what it is supposed to do.\n\nWebsite: https://www.mailvelope.com\nSource code: https://github.com/mailvelope/mailvelope\nDocumentation: https://www.mailvelope.com/en/faq\nQuick Start Guide: https://www.mailvelope.com/en/help\n\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/mailvelope\n",

    "description": "HLS Downloader lets you easily download fragmented media files (with .ts file extension) from the internet. \n\nHLS or HTTP Live steam is a new media format developed by Apple Inc. It contains a master playlist with the \".m3u8\" file extension. First, the extension downloads the master playlist, and then within the master, it finds playlist content. Each playlist has several fragmented items. All items are displayed in the UI with a download and a remove button. When you press the download button the extension downloads all fragmented media and merges them all to generate a single media file. \n\nNote 1: the interface for the extension can be opened in a new tab or a separate window. Please right-click on the toolbar button to choose the appropriate context. Within the UI, there is a toggle button to turn the addon ON or OFF.\n\nNote 2: HLS Downloader is NOT responsible for media content that you download with this add-on. We strongly recommend that you verify the related media copyright permissions on each website before downloading any media file(s).\n\nNote 3: to download the HLS stream you gave 3 options. (1) To add a stream URL manually, please enter the desired URL with the \".m3u8\" file extension in the UI. (2) As you browse the internet, this extension monitors the webpages and captures all HLS media files, and if anything is found, automatically downloads the playlist and updates the badge number accordingly (only when the addon is turned ON). The 3rd option for downloading the HLS stream is via the context-menu item. Please right-click on \".m3u8\" streams and then select - Download with HLS Downloader - from the context menu.\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill out the bug report form on the add-on's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/hls-downloader.html).",

This extension enables the user to adjust the current window's layout size based on the pre-defined set or any new custom dimension. Each dimension is visually shown in a toolbar popup for easy access. The extension gets left, top, right, and bottom positions in percent unit and changes the window size to these values. This extension detects all the monitors in your system and allows one of the monitors to be the reference for the alignment. Also, this extension supports keyboard shortcuts for the first six alignments in the popup. It means that you can re-align to any of these six alignments without opening the popup and just by pressing a user-defined keyboard set. Each item in the popup is draggable. The user can change the arrangement of the items or even remove or add new items.\n\nNote: This extension uses a non-persistent background script to be completely idle when it is not active\n\nAs of version 0.1.4, you can define a custom window size for the startup. Once the extension loads, it sets this user-defined window size for the currently active window.",
