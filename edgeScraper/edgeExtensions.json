It’s the full-featured version!\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: This extension will only work if you have the Cyclonis Password Manager desktop application already installed on your computer. You may download the FREE \"Cyclonis Password Manager Desktop\" application from the Microsoft Store.\r\n\r\n \r\nUsing just a single password for multiple online accounts? Is keeping track of your many passwords an impossible task? With Cyclonis Password Manager, you can manage, organize and control all your passwords in one central place. Cyclonis Password Manager stores your data in a personal vault, that is encrypted with AES-256 bit, an encryption algorithm used by governments, financial institutions, and in military applications. \r\n\r\nCyclonis Password Manager encrypts your vault using your master password. Your master password is for your eyes only – your data cannot even be accessed by Cyclonis staff or servers as we never transmit or store your master password.\r\n\r\nSigning up to a new social media website? This means that you should create a new and unique password. Let Cyclonis Password Manager take care of this tedious process for you. Using Cyclonis Password Manager’s password generator, you can create complex passwords that are designed to help avert the most popular password-cracking methods. Of course, no password, no matter how complex, can be 100% guaranteed against being compromised. Best of all, you can save your new social media account’s login details to your Cyclonis Password Manager vault, accessible directly from your web browser. The next time you visit that social media website, Cyclonis Password Manager’s browser extension can auto-fill your username and password, and even log you in automatically.\r\n\r\nThere's no point in having your data consolidated if you can't easily access it. This is where the Cyclonis Password Manager browser extension comes in. It automatically connects to the Cyclonis Password Manager desktop application and enters your login details for you for each website that you have stored in your vault, saving you time and the frustration of having to manually type your login details. Just navigate to the website and let Cyclonis Password Manager’s browser extension automatically fill in the username and password fields. It can even be configured to log you in automatically by activating the “Sign in” button. There’s no typing, no copying, and no pasting.\r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n\r\n- View, add, edit, delete, and manage your passwords from a searchable vault.\r\n- Use your passwords in multiple browsers on multiple devices.\r\n- Search your vault and navigate to your favorite websites with just a few clicks.\r\n- Log in to your favorite websites automatically. \r\n- Option to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your Cyclonis Password Manager account.\r\n- The Cyclonis Password Manager Password Generator helps you create complex passwords and update your website accounts.\r\n- The Cyclonis Password Manager Password Analyzer checks the complexity and strength of your website account passwords.\r\n-  Integrates with your browser to enable you to store your usernames and passwords to your Cyclonis Password Manager vault with a few clicks.\r\n- Automatically fill in long registration forms and checkout pages with the profile data that you have stored in your vault.\r\n- Import your website account usernames and passwords from other password managers.\r\n- View and edit your website accounts, Private Notes, personal profiles, ID documents, credit card details, bank account information and other sensitive data."

Please note that all the entries should be comma separated. Once you filled the bypass area, please mark the related checkbox as well (the checkbox next to the Bypass category).\n\nIn order to set PAC proxy, please add a PAC URL to the designated area (PATH input area). Please note that a PAC path should have a certain format. For example if your PAC file is located in - C:// - folder (on windows machine), please write - file:///C:/pac.data - in the PATH area. If you do not know how to write a PAC file, please read this (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config) Wikipedia page.

    "description": "This extension protects user privacy by prevents the HTML canvas element from being used by malicious scripts for fingerprinting the user. This extension adds a slight noise to the data generated by the canvas element when certain methods are being called. This way the canvas element cannot be used for fingerprinting purposes. Compared to other similar extensions, this one is lighter and uses a more effective method to block fingerprinting from all frame elements (top and subframes). The extension supports three modes of operation:\n\n  1. Random noise\n  2. Random noise (per session) (to have a fixed identity for current page session)\n  3. Fixed noise (to have a fixed but unique identity all the time)\n\nFeatures:\n  1. Fingerprint defender with as minimum footprint as possible\n  2. Block or disable fingerprint on certain hostnames\n  3. Notify when the canvas fingerprint is detected\n  4. Disable notification for a few hostnames or for all hostnames.\n  5. Works on cross-origin (CORS) and sandboxed iframes (like Disqus and Hangouts)\n\nNotes:\n  1. There is no on and off button as the extension is not meant to be disabled. If there is a use case of the on and off button please report on the FAQs page (review section)\n  2. This extension does not block the canvas element entirely. It only modifies two methods to prevent the JavaScript engine from generating a unique identification key from this element.\n\nWhat is Canvas Fingerprinting:\nCanvas fingerprinting is one of a number of browser fingerprinting techniques for tracking online users that allow websites to identify and track visitors using the HTML5 canvas element instead of browser cookies or other similar means. Canvas fingerprinting works by exploiting the HTML5 canvas element. When a user visits a page, the fingerprinting script first draws text with the font and size of its choice and adds background colors. Next, the script calls Canvas API's ToDataURL method to get the canvas pixel data in dataURL format, which is basically a Base64 encoded representation of the binary pixel data. Finally, the script takes the hash of the text-encoded pixel data, which serves as the fingerprint.\n\nIt is recommended to install an adblocker extension along with this defender (e.g. uBlock Origin or Adblock Plus)."

Most consumers may have dozens of password-protected accounts. Users with multiple accounts needing passwords often give up and use the same password, or a derivative of the same password for every account which makes them easy targets for hackers. When consumers are required to follow existing security policies and use various log-ins or passwords, they usually end up writing down their passwords making them easy targets.\n\nLogMeOnce Solution\n\nLogMeOnce dashboard offers simple user friendly access for each user to their unique web site which entails a list of all of their applications, with security protection behind each Application icon. Simply click the icon of your desired Application, and you are logged in without the need to enter a username and password each time. Your security credentials for each Application are individually secured and encrypted with your unique encryption key, that only you are aware of.\n\nLogMeOnce alters browser new tab page upon user request to receive additional functionality.

    "description": "Vimium C is an open source browser extension that provides keyboard-based inner-page navigation, browser tab operations, and an enhanced search panel, so you may take full advantages of your browser without a mouse or touchpad.\n\nIt supports all original commands of Vimium and some new useful commands (a full list can be seen in a help dialog in the Vimium C Options page). And it can map a same key sequence to different commands for different websites (and/or for different active elements in page).\n\nFor example:\n* press `f` to hint all clickable elements of the current web page\n* press `o` to show a search panel (\"Vomnibar\", a safe iframe) to search in your history, bookmarks, opened tabs and configured search engines, and you can even remove a history or tab by selecting a search result and pressing Shift+Delete\n* press j, k, h, l to scroll down/up/left/right on web pages\n* press \"/\" to search for text; press \"v\" to enter Visual Mode (just like VIM)\n* press Shift+J, Shift+K, `g0`, `g$` to switch to the previous/next/first/last tab\n* press `x` to remove a tab, and Shift+X to restore recently closed tabs (sessions), and many other commands\n* command repetition: for example, pressing `5X` (`5`, Shift+X) will restore 5 recent closed tabs\n* configure key mappings to bind Vimium C's tens of commands to other key sequences, and add options to switch command behaviors\n* apply block lists and allow lists of key mappings on configurable special websites and URLs\n\nIt can copy any selected text and current tab's title and URL to the system clipboard, and read the clipboard to search the copied text using a specified search engine.\n\nIt can also enable/disable websites' image loading and even JavaScript execution, if you trigger its command \"toggleCS\". This functionality requires a permission of \"Change your settings that control websites' access to features such as cookies, JavaScript ...\", and Vimium C promises that it won't do any thing secretly, but only act on what key sequences you press.\n\nIt will provide 8 \"global\" browser shortcuts: createTab, previousTab, nextTab, reloadTab, and some others, so you may bind some key sequences to them, and then these commands will work even when a page has no focus (e.g. when the browser address bar is focused).\n\nIt will register an omnibox keyword \"v\", and if you input \"v\" and press Space on the browser address bar (omnibox), you can do searches for history, bookmarks and tabs just like you're inputting on its Vomnibar.\n\nIt supports encoded URLs, and you can search Chinese, Japanese and Korean words in URLs of history and bookmarks. You may configure it to decode URLs in a charset of your locale .\n\nIt will download all synced settings from the Internet during the first installation, and you may enable/disable the syncing on certain computers.\n\nIf you have any exclusion rule for key mappings, it will monitor browser tab URL changes to re-check whether a new URL matches your URL pattern list.\n\nVimium C may show a notification when it gets upgraded to a new minor version.\n\nFor more information about release notes, rebinding your keys and how to use many of Vimium C's features, please see here: https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c#readme , or https://gitee.com/gdh1995/vimium-c#git-readme . There're also wiki pages.\n\n## Special note\n\nThe developer (gdh1995) can not use the comment functionality of Microsoft Edge Add-ons (I don't know why), so if you meet any question or bug, please go to https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c/issues and file an issue.\n\n## Declaration for Applicable Regions\n\nWhen people in \"all regions\" visit this store, Vimium C and other extensions published by [gdh1995](https://github.com/gdh1995) are always available.\nBut This behavior is only to make these extensions easier to use, but DOES NOT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED the author (gdh1995) \"agrees or has no objection to\" that \"Taiwan\" can be parallel to \"China\", which was an **inappropriate** status quo in the stores' pages on 2021-06-03.\n\nAccording to [The Constitution of the People's Republic of China](http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/c505/201803/e87e5cd7c1ce46ef866f4ec8e2d709ea.shtml) and international consensus, Taiwan is an inalienable part of the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China."

    "description": "# gimme gimme gimme\nA WebExtension for downloading media from webpages, especially tuned downloading image galleries with thumbnails that point to detail pages with large versions of the image on them. It also supports downloading the media shown on a page, and digging galleries of galleries. You'll find code for experimental features for downloading audio and for downloading video (the buttons are just hidden), but the gallery digging is always priority #1.\n\nTwo terms are used for the automatic media-finding: Dig and Scrape. Dig is for galleries, and galleries of galleries -- sites where one must dig into the detail pages to find the original media. Scrape is for getting media that is directly on the page.\n\nAs mentioned before, code is there to download video and audio files as well, but is not currently exposed and has not been tested much. Feel free to un-hide the extra buttons in popup/style.css to download the other media types. The event handlers and back-end are all set up, just the buttons are hidden.\n\nThis extension works with Chrome, Firefox, and Edge -- it can be found in all three extension stores in addition to in this repo.\n\n\n# v0.4.13\nBugfixes were plentiful. Lots of valid images were being discarded for nitpicky ivory-tower-only reasons. Upgraded npm packages too.\n\nUpdated options/preferences page to work again.\n\n# v0.4.14 \nGlaring problems that plagued v0.4.13 have been tracked-down and fixed!! The v0.4.14 branch was finally created and dedicated to making GimmeGimmeGimme a better product. That's the priority, getting you the media desired repeatably and faster. Those TypeScript and gallery-def \"ML\" bits will wait. (See \"The Future\" below.)\nLazy-loaded thumbnails for a gallery always resulted in only one media match, as all the thumbUris point to the same thumbnail image file at the same at the time of the gallery\ncraping. Now, when dupe thumb uri values are found, they are salted in their querystring with an extra param. This fixes about 80% of the times Gimme would fail miserably and only\nreturn one zoom-item! Now, with the salting, the map structures are resiliant in the face of these lazy, tricky galleries, and the full-sized linked zoom-media gets correctly identified, harvested, and presented as options. The text for the options is already correct, but for clarity we need to add a built-in thumb image to semantically represent what's going on.\nTensorFlow classifications were getting their Promise resolves and rejections seriously messed-up. Some code paths failed to yield any type of resolution whatsoever, and that was why there were so many near-permanent hangs only recoverable via reloading the extension or quitting and restarting the browser. The bugs were deep and convoluted in our promise structures built for the TF classifications, and took a lot of teasing out. Now the damn thing works way more reliably, and doesn't waste your time by processing 90% of a huge gallery-gallery-dig only to stop dead and piss you off.\nMeanwhile: the webpack and babel usage has been further refined, libs have been pegged to specific versions, downloading has had its perf improved a bit, comments have been iterated on, some code naming issues are better, and it's on a more alright trajectory again.\nOther stuff and fixes etc la la la who fucking cares. The new mantra is RELIABILITY AND USABILITY. This is still just code-noodling at the end of the day, but it shouldn't make you want to pull your hair out from frustration.\nThe best update so far is the \"go back to the top\" arrow in the popup. Oh, Totally"

    "description": "Save time, sign in easily to websites and avoid the hassle of forgotten password resets.\n\nProtect yourself and people you know from the nightmare of your accounts being hacked.\n\n➤ Secure and automatic sign in to all your favourite websites\n➤ Protect your personal and financial data by letting Kee create and remember high security passwords for you\n➤ Your passwords stay under your control, protected by the most popular and thoroughly tested open source secure password storage system\n➤ Open source with no adverts\n\n★ No payment required\n\nKee offers an easy and cheap password management solution via the Kee Vault service. This is available for a free trial period with no credit card required. If you decide that's not for you, the add-on can instead work with the free KeePass Password Safe 2 software and we offer step by step instructions for how to install and configure that to work on your Windows machine (and it can also be made to work on Mac and Linux with a bit more effort, with multiple guides existing to help in that endeavour)\n\n★ Who we are\n\nKee has been the most highly rated Mozilla Firefox password management extension for nearly 10 years! We recently changed our icon to coincide with the launch of the extension in browsers other than Firefox and the announcement of the Kee Vault password manager service.\n\nYou can look forward to even more improvements in future and join the discussion on the community forum at https://forum.kee.pm/ to let us know what features you'd most like to see developed next.\n\n★ Having trouble?\n\nIf you would like to try Kee and it is not working for you, please use the help resources at https://forum.kee.pm/t/help-and-support/24 since requests for support within review comments will remain un-noticed for a year or longer.\n\nYou should pay particular attention to the full detailed installation instructions at https://forum.kee.pm/t/installing-kee-instructions/23, the getting started tutorial at https://tutorial-addon.kee.pm/ and any advice at the top of that page.\n\n★ Permissions\n\nKee needs a variety of permissions to deliver it's functionality to you. We maintain a page that details these permissions and why we require them at https://www.kee.pm/extension-permissions/.\n\nThe built-in Edge password manager will no longer prompt you to save passwords after you install this add-on. Any existing data will not be affected but you are strongly advised to delete any stored passwords from your Edge password store in order to increase the security of your personal data and to avoid possible confusion in future."

If yes, then the Copyfish free OCR software is for you.\n\nCommon reasons to extract text from images are to google it, store it, email it or translate it. Until now, your only option was to retype the text. Copyfish is soooo much faster and more fun.\n\n“Images” come in many forms: photographs, charts, diagrams, screenshots, PDF documents, comics, error messages, memes, Flash – and Youtube movies.\n\nYou can verify the results in one glance with the extracted text overlay.\n\nDo you need to switch between OCR languages often? You can define \"Quick Switch\" buttons for up to three languages on the settings page.\n\nFor language learners: There are many translator addons available, but they only work with plain website text. Text inside images, in tricky Javascript/AJAX or, especially, in movie subtitles on Youtube or Youku is unreachable for them. But not for Copyfish. And if you want, Copyfish also translates the text for you. Especially for the subtitle translation use case, Copyfish has a repeat feature. Mark the area of the subtitle once and then use the \"Do OCR\" button to grab the latest text from the movie screen.\n\nFor developers: Copyfish is published under the GPL open-source license. As OCR software, it uses the free OCR API from https://ocr.space/ .\n\nQUESTIONS? SUGGESTIONS? Please email copyfish@ocr.space"

This extension was made to help all the users participating in numerous meetings, classes, and events happening over Google Meet.\n\n\nFeatures added:\n\n1. Set the default Google Account:\nWhen you have multiple Google accounts and you join a meet link to realize that it's not linked to the correct Google account, you have to switch the accounts to join with the right one manually. Instead, set the Google Account Number (https://imgur.com/a/58dSAWS) - usually as 0, 1, 2, to auto-redirect to the correct Google Account.\n\n2. Auto Join:\nBypass the intermediary screen and directly join the meeting.\n\n3. Auto Mute Audio and Video:\nNo need to manually mute audio and video for every meeting. It's done automatically for you.\n\n4. Push to Talk:\nYou can unmute and speak by enabling the push to talk feature. We now support Space and Left Shift keys. Just press and hold the key to speak, and when done, release the key. Its that simple. If you need to mute/unmute, simply tap the key.\n\n5. Auto Enable Captions:\nCaptions are turned on by default when you enter the meeting.\n\n6. Copy URL button:\nIt's a tedious process to share just the meeting URL with another person. We have a quick solution for that.\n\n7. Quit the meeting using keys:\nJust press 'Ctrl' + 'Q' to quit any meeting directly. No more awkwardly searching for the \"End Call\" button.\n\n\n\nCheck the options page to enable or disable these features depending on your requirements.\n\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nWe don't store your data. Period.  \n\nAcknowledgments:\nSourabh Jain [https://github.com/sourabh10995] for helping me out with the development of this extension.\nMithun Mohan [https://dribbble.com/mthnmhn] for the designs and icons.\n\nIf anyone wants to contribute to the project, please do let me know.\n\nUpcoming features:\n\n1. Ability to select the Google account (Including your profile details instead of the numbers)\n2. Raise the Hands feature\n3. More keys for Push To Talk\n4. Record Meeting to the main screen.\n5. Jump to Google Meet Tab from anywhere when you click on the extension\n\nPlease spread the word!\n"

Ads that streamer embeds directly into the stream will be shown.\n\n• “Audio only” mode. Ideal for music listening.\n\n• The extension automatically opens chests with bonus points in chat.\n\n• You can set the size and location of the chat, even while in full-screen mode.\n\n• In chat (for example, attached to the bottom or top side of the window) there is room for much more messages and emotes.\n\n• You can completely disable the chat: it will not consume computer resources, and you will not be in the chatters list.\n\n• Allows you to select the device for audio output (if more than one device is available): speakers, headphones, TV, etc.\n\n• Changes volume by mouse wheel.\n\n• You can colorize the player interface to your liking.\n\n• Takes up less RAM.\n\n• Rapid start-up of the player. This is especially noticeable on slower computers.\n\n• Allows you to disable stretching the small video to the player size.\n\n• Allows you to continue viewing the broadcast in another player, for example Media Player Classic, VLC Media Player, or MX Player.\n\n• Large number of useful (and not so) settings.\n\nThe extension during installation requires the following permissions:\n\n• Read and change your data on a number of websites where Twitch stores its video. The list of websites may expand over time.\n\n• Manage your apps, extensions, and themes. Actually the extension just reads the list of installed extensions. This is necessary in order to load into the chat only those extensions that you have installed yourself in your browser. Only the following browser extensions can work in chat: BetterTTV, FrankerFaceZ and FFZ Add-On Pack.\n\nAlso read the Privacy Policy (link on this page) for further details.\n\nThe player can playback only live broadcasts and does not affect playback of videos.\n\nI do not recommend using the extension without a mouse, because touch screen support is incomplete.\n\nIf you have problems with the extension, first read the help. To do this, in the player right click the view area, then in the menu click “Help”. If you still have questions, then in the same menu click \"Send Feedback\". If you cannot start the player, send an e-mail to the extension developer. The e-mail address is located somewhere on this page.\n\nThis extension is not an official Twitch application. The extension was created by independent developer, who is not affiliated with Twitch Interactive, Inc company in any way. The extension inserts part of the Twitch.tv website — chat — into extension player.\n\nThe extension is also available for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers."

Purity.\n\nFor the latest news and info such as updates and bug fixes, please make sure you like the F.B. Purity Fan Page on Facebook via the following shortcut: \nhttps://fans.fbpurity.com\n\n\nF.B. Purity cleans the application spam and other annoying messages off your Facebook homepage. It adds a small information bar at the top of your Facebook homepage / news feed. It tells you how many game/application posts its hidden and also how many other \"Extra\" post types (which you can specify in the options screen) it has hidden. The options screen is accessible by clicking the FBP link in the top Navigation Bar.\n\nHeres a list of the different post types you can hide:\n\nFacebook Questions (and answers), Became friends with, Liked page (became a fan), Joined a group, Attending an event, Attended an event, Created an event, Changed location (Checked in/Travelling to/Travelled to), Updated profile, Changed profile picture, Updated Cover Photo, Changed relationship, Commented on or likes status, Uploaded photo, Tagged in (aka mentioned in), likes or commented on photo, Tagged in, likes or commented on album, Uploaded video, Tagged in video, Posted a link, Commented on or likes link, Posted a note, Tagged in note, Commented on wall, Commented on group wall, Commented on page wall, Wrote on Timeline (User,Page,Group,Event etc Timelines), Hide Fan Page Updates, Hide Shared Photos, Hide Shared Links, Commented on \"This\", Liked \"This\", Facebook Memories, Your Memories (aka \"On this day\"), Shared Memories (Shared a memory), \"Is Live / Was Live\" (Facebook Live Video)\n\nYou can filter out any subject on Facebook that doesnt interest you, using the \"Text Filter\" function, for example say you were not interested in Politics, you could put the relevant keywords/phrases that get mentioned in Political posts, such as the names of the Political party members, the party names, etc into the Text Filter box, and FBP will filter out any posts from the Newsfeed including that text. You can also use the Text Filter to filter out any mention of celebrities you are not interested in hearing about, such as Kanye, The Kardashians, etc.\n\nF.B. Purity now also has an image content filter that lets you filter out images of cats, dogs, selfies, babies, memes, food, smoking and also lets you set your own custom image content filters.\n\nYou can also hide any of the links in the right hand column, such as: Events, Games and App Requests, Recommended Pages, Suggested Groups, People You May Know / Find More Friends, Get Connected, Pokes, Friend Requests, Birthdays, Chat, the News Ticker bar, Trending Topics / Trending Hashtags\n\nMore Features\n-----------------------\n* An option to Force facebook to sort newsfeed by \"Most Recent\"\n* An option to sort your notifications in the correct Chronological order\n* Hide all game and application posts, including \"Games your friends are playing\" and \"Games you may like\". It also gives you the option to whitelist application posts that you do want to see in your Newsfeed, so the app/game spam filter wont hide them.\n* Adds an easily accesible Block Application (\"BA\") link to every game/app post, so you can easily block games/apps from your news-stream and from getting your personal data.\n* The \"BA\" (Block Application) link now lets you block multiple applications with a single click.

SafeToOpen Online Security warns you if a web page is risky and reassures you if it is safe. \n \nWhat distinguishes SafeToOpen Online Security from other browser extensions, anti-viruses, and secure email gateways is the ability to detect never-before-seen or zero-day phishing web pages in real-time.

Most times this was done under high time pressure. Even if a project start was delayed, the fieldwork go-live date was never moved.\n\nFor testing was never enough time and so the QA team never was able to find all issues inside the surveys. The first two days of fieldwork were used to fix the late found issues and to change the survey due to customer change requests.\n\n \n\nSounds familiar?\n\n\nEven today, when talking to corporate Market Research departments or full-service Market Research specialists, it does not show a different picture. With the rise of mobile devices and a fragmented browser market, the situation is today even worse than ever. \"Traditional\" testing methods using Excel, Emails, and Screenshots are not sufficient enough for getting the best possible results and making the timelines​.

I am more interested in getting a sort order of my choice as default so I do not have to manually change it everytime I search for a product. Therefore, I ended up building this extension that automatically shows only the sort order that I want to see. \n\nSo, if you are like me and you want to set a default sort method instead of always clicking on the sort order and selecting \"Average Customer Reviews\" or \"Price: Low to High\", this extension is for you. It will save you a click and selecting the right sort order. There is also an OFF switch if you choose to go wild and opt for a different sort method without changing your default.\n\nThis is an early release. I will keep updating it every now and then. Please send me your honest critical feedback on harshankur@outlook.com. It will make me build a better product for a bigger set of audience.\n\nTHANK YOU!"

    "description": "This is a 1-Click Button extension that works with or without the URL Incrementer extension. If you have URL Incrementer installed, you'll be able to select the part of the URL to increment or decrement and all other options. If you don't have URL Incrementer installed, the button will simply try to increment or decrement the most likely number in the URL (usually the last number).\n\nMini FAQ\n\nQ: Do I need URL Incrementer installed to use this button?\nNope, not anymore (as of Version 5.9)! If you don't have URLI installed, the button will simply default to try to smartly increment or decrement the most likely number in the URL (usually the last number). If you need to choose a different part of the URL, then you would need to install the \"URL Incrementer\" extension and use it to setup the selection first.\n\nQ: I have URL Incrementer installed. Do I need this?\nNope! Think of this as only a convenient 1-click button for your toolbar.\n\nQ: Why is this a separate extension?\nExtensions are limited to only one toolbar icon. So, URL Incrementer can't offer you a 1-click button because of all the various buttons it needs to show you in its popup (Increment, Increment, Clear, and so on). The popup is also really annoying and closes easily if you click outside of it, and it also requires two clicks to perform an action.\n\nQ: Does this consume resources... am I going to regret installing this?\nYou won't! The background memory has been set to \"persistent\": false so the button consumes 0 Browser Memory when you're not using it.\n\nQ: How does it work with URL Incrementer?\nIt simply sends a message to URL Incrementer each time you click it to perform the action in 1 click. You can just click it and use it like a Quick Shortcut, or use URL Incrementer first to select the part of the URL to increment/decrement and the interval and other options, and all these settings will take effect when you click the button.\n\nPermissions Justification\nURL Decrement Button requires no special permissions.\n\nRemote Code Policy\nURL Decrement Button does *not* use any remote code. All code is included locally in the software package and goes under review before being published.\n\nPrivacy Policy\nURL Decrement Button does *not* track you. It does *not* use analytic services. It does *not* collect or transmit any data from your device or computer. All your data is stored locally on your device. Your data is *your* data."

Once installed, an icon featuring the Office Spinner logo will appear in your browser, enabling you to request beverages from your colleagues who are also using the extension and connected to the same internet connection.\n\nThe app automatically adds everyone who has installed the extension to the participant list, allowing them to indicate whether they would like to receive a drink. Once everyone has responded, a roulette wheel will appear on all computers, randomly selecting the person who will have to fetch beverages for the group. The loser will receive a notification, and the app has additional tools such as the sit-stand desk feature to remind users to change their posture.\n\nOffice Spinner is a free app, but you can also sign up for a PLUS account to support the app's development, gain access to more statistics, and create groups. With a PLUS account, the app will also be ad-free.\n\nTo log in, you can use your LinkedIn, Google (including Workspace business accounts), Microsoft Account (including Office 365), or Twitter account, which will provide your first name. We plan to introduce other methods of identifying users in the future.\n\nIf you encounter any issues, discover errors, or have any great ideas, please contact us at sebastiaan@officespinner.com. Try Office Spinner today and add some fun to your workday!"

    "description": "Please refresh the page that needs to be translated after installation or update! ! !\n\nIntroduction\n\nWelcome to Edge Translate!\n\nEdge Translate is a simple and practical translation plugin that supports mainstream browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and 360 Secure Browser . The main purpose of our plugin is to assist users in reading foreign literature. To this end, we have followed the principle of the user's reading experience first, and made the following efforts:\n\n* Google Translate API\n\nWe use the API provided by Google Translate to translate words and sentences, which guarantees the accuracy of translation results to a certain extent;\n\n* PDF File Supported\n\nWe support the translation of wording in PDF files, which breaks the dyslexia of many users when reading PDF documents (due to the Firefox browser's bug, this feature is temporarily unavailable on Firefox browser);\n\n* Reading Friendly Result Displaying\n\nWe chose the friendly side pop-up to show the translation results. The pop-up display bar will push the user reading content to avoid blocking the content from affecting the reading;\n\n* Simple and Clear Look\n\nWe designed a simple and clear translation result display column, highlighting important content, and ensuring that the user's attention is focused on the content displayed rather than the insignificant things such as the display box;\n\n* Fix The Result Frame\n\nIf the frequency of the your translation is relatively high, you can choose to fix the display bar to avoid frequent pop-ups affecting reading.\n\n* Fully Customizable\n\nWe allow users to decide for themselves which content in the translation results they need to display. For example, if you just want to know the meaning of the word, you can choose to view only the common meaning of the word. If you also want to learn the specific usage of a word, we also provide the pronunciation, definition, detailed explanation, example sentence, etc. of the word in more detail. Content for you to view;\n\n* Efficient Shortcuts\n\nWe have provided a wealth of shortcut keys to make the operation efficiency greatly improved. Now you only need to use the keyboard to complete the translation of selected words, expand the search panel, fix and unpin the translation results;\n\n* Website Blacklist\n\nWe provide a useful blacklist feature that allows you to easily add a page you are browsing to a blacklist to disable wording translations and double-click translations on the page, or to remove the page being viewed from the blacklist to re-enable word translation and double click translation on this page.\n\n* Whole Page Translating\n\nWe support web page translation and can translate the entire web page directly into the language you need. And you are free to choose YouDao web page translation or Google web page translation to fully meet your translation needs.\n\nThe birth of Edge Translate is inseparable from the open source community. In the development process of Edge Translate, we used Mozilla's pdf.js as a built-in PDF reader to support word translation in PDF files. We refered to crimx's saladict for solutions of some problems. We also used gulp, webpack and other excellent open source tools to assist in development. And we would like to express our gratitude.\n\nWe are also grateful to users who have used Edge Translate since 0.2.0 and provided us with feedback. You have provided us with a lot of very good comments and suggestions. Without you, there may no be the current Edge Translate.\n\n* Instructions\nEdge Translate instructions : \n\nhttps://github.com/EdgeTranslate/EdgeTranslate/blob/master/docs/wiki/en/Instructions.md\n\n* Precautions\nEdge Translate precautions : \n\nhttps://github.com/EdgeTranslate/EdgeTranslate/blob/master/docs/wiki/en/Precautions.md\n\nQuestions and Feedback\nEdge Translate were developed by us ( nickyc975 and Mark Fenng ) in our spare time, and there are inevitably some problems. If you have any comments or suggestions, please feel free to give us feedback at the first time and help us to make it better.\n\nFeedback link：https://github.com/EdgeTranslate/EdgeTranslate/issues/new/choose\n\nEmail: nickyc975 : chenjinlong2016@outlook.com, Mark Fenng : f18846188605@gmail.com\n\nIn addition, developers are welcome to give us issues and pull requests. If you like this project, welcome to fork & star."

The extension adds an action button to your browser toolbar area. Pressing the button opens a panel that displays all the matching credentials for the current domain. You can ask the extension to insert the username, password, or both by pressing the action buttons. The extension also optionally submit the login form if you would like to. This extension offers a built-in OTP (One-time password) tool, so you don't need to have a separate plugin. \n\nThis extension supports the following applications:\n1. KeePass application with KeePassHttp installed\n2. KeePassXC with a custom manifest (uses native messaging to communicate)\n3. Direct read of KDBX3 or KDBX4 databases (when you cannot install a native application)\n4. Any other alternatives that support HTTP communication (such as MacPass)\n\nNotes:\n1. When using this extension, first make sure the login or password input box is focused on the page before opening the panel. Username and password filling occur if an input element is selected on a form.\n2. It is recommended to use the extensions manager of your browser to define a custom shortcut for this extension. This way you can fill the username and password fields without using your mouse. This extension supports keyboard shortcuts for almost all the actions.\n3. It is possible to generate one-time password tokens using this extension.\n4. This extension optionally supports automatic logins (this feature is not yet supported on manifest v3).\n4. This extension also supports native messaging communication for  KeePassXC. Go to the options page to configure the extension to work with KeePassXC.\n5. As of version 0.6.7, the extension supports reading the native string fields of KeePass for generating time-based passwords (\"TimeOtp-Secret-Base32\", \"TimeOtp-Period\" and \"TimeOtp-Length\" keys are supported)\n6. If you are not using the built-in OTP feature of the KeePass application, the OTP can optionally be stored in SHA-256 encryption. This is additional password protection for your secret keys.\n\nFAQs Page:\n  http://add0n.com/keepass-helper.html\nBug Reports:\n  https://github.com/belaviyo/keepass-macpass-helper/\nPrivacy Policy:\n  https://add0n.com/policies/unixeco.txt\n\nSetup to work with KeePass application:\nRequirements:\n1. KeePass 2 (http://keepass.info) --  version 2.17 or newer\n2. KeePassHttp (https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp/) --  download link is https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp/blob/master/KeePassHttp.plgx\n\nDirections:\n1) Install KeePass\n2) Install KeePassHttp plugin by dropping KeePassHttp.plgx into the KeePass Program Files directory\n2a) Restart and login to your KeePass application\n2b) Verify KeePassHttp has been installed correctly by checking Tools > Plugins\n3) Navigate to any page containing a password\n4) Click the toolbar button\n5) Switch to the KeePass window, enter a descriptive name into the dialog that popped up, and click the save button (the popup window of the KeePassHelper extension needs to be open during this process).\n6) Your passwords are now securely retrieved from KeePass and automatically entered into password forms and fields when needed.\n"

First performed on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personae to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways.\n"

Planowane kartkówki, odpowiedzi ustne, a może prace domowe, o których nie chcesz zapomnieć, a nie zostały wpisane przez nauczyciela? Z tym rozszerzeniem jest to wreszcie możliwe! Idealne na problemy z pamięcią.\n\n⭐️ Obliczanie średniej ocen 📈\nNiektóre szkoły wyłączają możliwość wyświetlania średniej ocen dla ich uczniów i rodziców. Na szczęście Twój komputer potrafi dodawać, mnożyć i dzielić, więc sobie sam poradzi :) W tabeli znajdziesz także odpowiednio średnią z całego semestru, z ocen proponowanych, ze śródrocznych, a także ze wszystkich ocen cząstkowych (średnia roczna).\n\n⭐️ Wyświetlanie procentowej frekwencji z przedmiotów 🎓\nZastanawiasz się ile masz procent frekwencji z danego przedmiotu? Może chcesz wiedzieć, ile jeszcze lekcji możesz opuścić, aby nadal być klasyfikowanym? Nie ma sprawy. W zakładce Frekwencja wystarczy, że naciśniesz odpowiedni przycisk, a Twoje procenty obecności magicznie się pojawią.\n\n⭐️ Ukrywanie przedmiotów bez ocen 🚫\nPo co w ogóle mają się wyświetlać, skoro przez cały rok nie dostaniesz z nich ani jednej oceny?\n\n⭐️ Wyświetlanie numerka z dziennika i \"Szczęśliwy Numerek\" 🔢\nNie możesz nigdy zapamiętać, który masz numerek w dzienniku? Od teraz będzie zawsze widniał na górze strony obok \"Szczęśliwego Numerka\", abyś go już nigdy nie zapomniał(a). Jeśli w Twojej szkole jest włączona opcja jego losowania, to już nigdy nie przegapisz tego, kiedy będzie nim Twój!\n\n⭐️ Modernizacja terminarza 📅\nPo co najeżdżać na każdą rzecz w terminarzu, aby przeczytać jej opis? Od teraz znajdziesz wszystko na wierzchu, bez konieczności najeżdżania! Wygoda ponad wszystko. Możesz także wyłączyć wyświetlanie swojej klasy pod każdym zdarzeniem, a także skorzystać z trybu modernizacji terminarza, który sprawia go trochę bardziej czytelnym i odchudzonym.\nJeśli Twoja szkoła udostępniła plan lekcji, to będziesz go również widzieć po najechaniu na symbol '≡' znajdujący się w kafelkach.\n(Zajrzyj do opcji rozszerzenia, aby włączyć/wyłączyć poszczególne funkcje)\n\n⭐️ Modernizacja dymków 📢\nDymki z dodatkowymi informacjami, które pojawiają się po najechaniu na oceny, nieobecności, bądź wydarzenia w terminarzu, od teraz nabierają nowych barw i wyglądają choć trochę lepiej, niż szare mury szkoły, do której uczęszczasz.\n\n⭐️ Tymczasowa modyfikacja ocen i kalkulator jedynek 📝\nGdy włączysz to ustawienie w widoku ocen, będziesz mógł(a) tymczasowo, lokalnie dodawać nowe oceny, bądź edytować i usuwać bieżące, aby sprawdzić jaką miał(a)byś wtedy średnią.\n(Po odświeżeniu strony wszystko wróci do stanu sprzed modyfikacji! Zmiany zachodzą jedynie lokalnie i nie mają wpływu na Twoje rzeczywiste oceny!)\nMożesz zobaczyć także ile jedynek możesz jeszcze dostać, aby nadal znajdować się powyżej danej średniej, w menu dodawania nowych ocen cząstkowych.\n\n⭐️ Wersja depresyjna 🕶\nStonowane kolory ocen i wydarzeń w terminarzu, gdy nie czujesz się najlepiej.

Thanks to your ratings, we can build an IMDb for articles, benefitting all internet users. As a thank you for your work, we will reward you with FLOQ Tokens. This tokenised approach will warrant active engagement. Authors that publish articles on Datafloq will also receive tokens depending on the quality of their article and their reputation. At this moment, the tokens are not yet worth anything, but once we have launched Mavin.org users can exchange their FLOQ tokens for MVN crypto tokens.\n\nDatafloq also offers a new search engine. This will allow users to find articles, or authors, based on quality, reputation, fake news probability or plagiarism probability — a novelty for the web.\n\nFor more information see: https://datafloq.com/plugin/faq"

    "description": "Crossfoam analyses and visualises your filter bubbles on social media (so far only Twitter), so you can discover the extent to which your online community is an echo chamber or a place of diverse opinions. Fine-grained analysis allows you to explore your social network, diversify it, or - if you prefer - dig deeper into your bubble. Crossfoam thus becomes a tool for electronic self-determination.\n\nIn order to enable this experience, Crossfoam allows you to select your own social media account (or some else’s) and download this account’s network onto your local computer. Then a network analysis is performed, which tries to identify clusters within your network (bubbles). You can then use the build-in visualisation system or download the data to use in another application.\n\nCrossfoam is build privacy first. All data, analysis and visualisation is happening on your local machine, no external services are involved."

If you're inside a project page (but not inside an issue), it tracks time to the project. You can also use a keyboard shortcut (Alt + R) to start/stop timing.\n\n*A page full of your projects*\nSome people don't always work on Redmine issues (like account managers) -- they need an easy way to jump from project to project and track time. Right-click anywhere on any page and choose \"Show Redmine Timer Buttons\" from the context menu.\n\nWhen you open the list, you'll see a touch-friendly list of those projects. I move this window onto my laptop screen (as opposed to my main external monitor) so I can simply touch the one I want to time.\n\n*Bugs*\nInstead of leaving a bad review, which will crush my soul, please add bug reports here: https://bitbucket.org/jprc8/redmine-timer-for-browsers/issues.\n\n*Notes*\nMy company uses this extension and it hasn't set anything on fire yet.

    "description": "Overview\n\nTalking clock provides time reminder and custom reminder functions, suitable for time and periodic task reminders in daily work and life. It can also display date and time.\nReminder methods include voice announcement and system notifications.\n\nThis extension is especially suitable for people who often work for a long time with desktop computer, such as writers, programmers, and people who work remotely or indoors.\n• Time reminder helps to manage the time while focusing on the work.\n• Custom reminders are suitable for periodic daily affairs, such as \"Remind me to have lunch at 11:30 every day\".\n\n1. Time Reminder\nIt announces the time periodically by voice engine and/or system notification. \n\nThe time interval can be set in the options of the extension:\n5 minutes / 10 minutes / 15 minutes / 20 minutes / 30 minutes / 1 hour / 2 hours / 3 hours.\n\nIn addition, there are several DnD(do not disturb) settings which enabled by default, such as don't remind me time if the browser is in full screen or playing video.\n\n2. Custom Reminder\nUsers can add custom reminders. Supported reminder types include:\n• Only once: only reminds on a specific date.\n• Daily reminder: reminder at one or more time every day.\n• Weekly reminder: choose one or more days from Monday to Sunday.\n• Monthly reminder: choose one or more days from the 1st day to the last day every month.\n• Annual reminder: choose one or more days every year, such as \"Birthday reminder\".\n\nAll types can set one or more reminder time on the reminder day. In this way, on the one hand, it can meet the needs of multiple reminders in one day for one thing. For example, \"Remind me to take medicine three times (in the morning, noon and evening) every day\", just create a daily reminder, which sets three reminder time. On the other hand, multiple reminder time can be set for important things to avoid missing it.\n\n3. Clock\nThe popup page displays current time and date by clicking the extension icon. In addition, the extension icon itself can also display the time (not enabled by default).\n\nIn the options for clock settings, you can set:\n• Display analog clock or digital clock.\n• Whether to display seconds.\n• Whether to display the date.\n• Whether to display the time on the extension icon.\n\n4. Other\nIn the extensions keyboard shortcuts settings(edge://extensions/shortcuts), you can set shortcuts for displaying the time and announcing the time.\n\n\nAbout Reminder Methods\nYou can use one or both of two reminder methods:\n• Voice announcement: announce the time or custom content by Text-to-Speech engine.\n• System notification: send a desktop notification.\n\nThe voice announcement will make a sound, so it may not be suitable for everyone. In addition, if you forget to turn on the speaker or the volume is too low, you will not hear it.\n\nSystem notification may also be missed if it disappears automatically. So:\n• System notification for time reminder will automatically disappear after a few seconds, because it's not very important.\n• Custom reminders are more important than time reminder. So to prevent missing it, system notification for custom reminders will disappear automatically after one minute by default, not a few seconds. You can set this behavior for each custom reminder separately.\n\nIn summary, voice announcements and system notifications can complement each other to avoid missing reminder.\n\n\nAbout Text-to-Speech (TTS)\nTTS includes the TTS provided by the operating system and the remote TTS provided by the browser. The former can be adjusted in the operating system settings, while the latter depends on the network connection. The operating system comes with a general voice effect, it is available offline; the voice provided by the browser is usually better, but it requires network connection.\n\nTTS is used by time reminder and custom reminders. In the extension options, you can set TTS voice. Each voice usually only supports text in one language, and may not read text correctly in other languages.\n\n\nHow to open extension options?\n• Right-click the extension icon, then click Options.\n• Click the extension icon, move the mouse to the popup page, then click the setting icon in the upper right corner.\n\n\nThis extension is not an alarm clock\nIt is suitable for daily affairs, but it is not an alarm clock. For example, if you want to catch a plane or get up early, please do not rely on this extension. Because the extension cannot issue a reminder when you exit the browser or when the computer goes into sleep. So it is not suitable for very important things.\n\nNote: due to a browser restriction, reminders/notifications may be delayed for a little time (less than 1 minute)."

We try to prevent such measures. If you encounter such issues you can always add a certain website to the blacklist.\n\nFunctionality:\n⭐ Easy setup: Just install the app, and all ad-blocking rules will be enabled automatically based on your geolocation.\n⭐ Low footprint: We care about your browser performance. Applying tons of blocking rules consume your CPU, RAM, and battery charge. We try our best to decrease this footprint.\n⭐ We don’t believe in the idea of “acceptable ads”.

    "description": "What is SmartProxy\nUsing proxies cannot be easier with SmartProxy. Think of it as configure once and forget solution. With SmartProxy you don't need to change your proxy manually or turn it on and off. All you have to do is to tell SmartProxy that you want to enable proxy for your desired website with just one click. After that, when you visit that specific website, SmartProxy will act and all you data for that website will be transferred though the proxy, without you doing anything.\n\nPlease note that:\n🚫 SmartProxy does not provide any type of proxy servers.\n👀 SmartProxy does not track you in any way.\n⭐️ SmartProxy is completely ad free in any way.\n\nSmartProxy\nIt uses patterns to automatically define rules to proxify your web experience. With SmartProxy, you don't need to change your proxy manually and turn it on and off. You can add your desired website to the proxy rules list with just one click. After that, when you visit that specific website, SmartProxy will act and all you data for that website will be transferred though the proxy, without you doing anything.\n\nWhat's more, SmartProxy is inspired by AutoProxy and AutoProxy-ng and that are now considered legacy. SmartProxy is completely written from ground up using WebExtensions and provides more functionality than those proxies.\n\nHighlights\n\n    Automatically detect when to enable or disable proxy to certain websites based on rule patterns\n    Easily switch between many proxy servers as your active proxy server setting\n    Easily with one click add current site to your proxy list\n    View current website items and requests and decide whether to proxify them with one click\n    Easily switch between proxy modes and enable proxy for all domains\n    Proxy API is supported through subscriptions\n    Backup/Restore settings and rules\n    Supporting GFWList\n\n\nDisclaimer: This addon is solely created to spread freedom by easing the access to blocked contents.

    "description": "Simple and seamless privacy protection for your browser.  \n\nProtecting your privacy online is like protecting your home. Locking the front door won’t stop the most determined folks from getting inside, especially if you’ve left the back door and windows unlocked and an extra key under the doormat. That’s why we offer multiple types of privacy protection, most of which aren’t offered in most popular browsers by default.   \n\nWith the press of a button, you get seamless protection from most 3rd-party trackers while you search and browse, access to tracking protections for emails you receive, and much more. Together these privacy essentials make more privacy your default.  \n \nFEATURE HIGHLIGHTS \n\n• Search Privately by Default - DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in, so you can easily search the web without being tracked. \n\n• Escape Website Trackers Before They Load - automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using (e.g. sale, ads, etc.) any data from these trackers. Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology goes well above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default. \n\n• Automatically Enforce Encryption - force many sites you visit to automatically use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, which helps shield your data from Wi-Fi snoopers and network onlookers like your Internet provider. Most popular browsers only direct users to encrypted versions of pages in specific circumstances, like when you navigate directly to a page in the address bar. We check our list of upgradable sites for all links you click. \n\n• Enable Built-in Email Protection - Over 85% of emails sent to Duck Addresses contained trackers that can detect when you’ve opened a message, where you were when you opened it, and what device you were using. Email Protection makes it easy to block most email trackers and hide your existing address when signing up for things online, all without switching email providers. \n\n• Escape Fingerprinting — helps stop companies from creating a unique identifier for you by blocking their attempts to combine specific information about your browser and device settings.  \n\n• Block Tracking Cookies — prevents most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site. \n \nADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS NOT AVAILABLE ON MOST BROWSERS \n\n• Link Tracking Protection — helps stop companies from gathering your browsing history and other information via personal identifiers embedded in the links you click on.  \n\n• Embedded Social Content Tracking Protection — blocks embedded Facebook content around the web so they can't track you through their videos, posts, and comments found on other sites. You can easily unblock to view them if desired.  \n\n• Google AMP Protection — forces sites to load content directly from publishers instead of using Google-owned links, which are full of creepy trackers.   \n\n• Signal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC) — built-into our app, GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction. \n\nNote about our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection following DuckDuckGo ad clicks: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Protection goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default, but we’re constantly working to make it more comprehensive. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.   \n\nRead more about this and our Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/privacy/web-tracking-protections/  \n\nYou don't need to wait to take back your privacy. Join the millions of people using DuckDuckGo and protect many of your everyday online activities. It's privacy, simplified. \n\nAbout Us: https://duckduckgo.com/about/ \nHow It Works: https://duckduckgo.com/app \nPrivacy Newsletter: https://duckduckgo.com/newsletter \nPrivacy Policy: https://duckduckgo.com/privacy/ \nOpen Source: https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension\n"

This is the magic that will keep you safe.\n\nWHY WEBSITE AUTHENTICATION?\n\nOver 93% of all new phishing websites start with https and display the browser padlock. It’s time to replace the padlock with the reputation shield for online trust.\n\nFREE TRIAL\n\nYou can try the software for free for 14 days. No credit card needed. And if you sign up, you can cancel your subscription at anytime. We also offer a 30 day money back guarantee.\n\nMost security products that are free, collect and sell your data. We think that’s creepy. That’s why ours is a paid service. Pricing here: https://metacert.com/pricing.html\n\nABOUT THE TEAM\n\nMetaCert is brought to you by the same developers who built the official browser extensions for digg, Delicious, Yahoo!, Nike, Sony, eBay, PayPal, Google and Microsoft. We build software that’s fast, secure and reliable.\n\nFounder and CEO Paul Walsh is one of the two people who co-instigated the creation of the standard for URL Classification at the W3C, the standard body for the World Wide Web - formally replacing PICS in 2009."

Just install our software extension today!\n\nInstall our Ethereum Price tracker today and see the historical prices of ethereum.\n\nHow do I get Ethereum?\nThere are two methods to get ethereum, the first method is to buy it online from a ethereum exchange. The second method is to try and mine for ethereum yourself.\n\nHow do I store my ethereum?\nEthereum can be stored by yourself vs online on other ethereum providers. There have been many prominent hacks of online ethereum providers before and it is not easy to choose between whether to trust a third party vs yourself. If you store it by yourself, you can do so via a USB drive etc.\n\nWhat happens if I lose my ethereum password?\nYou are out of luck if you lose your ethereum password. The lack of a central authority makes it impossible for you to get access to your ethereum again unless you have your password.\n\nIf you are interested in finding the price history of ethereum, just install our extension today.\n\nEthereum was meant to be used as a way to enforce contracts in a low cost and efficient manner. For example, ethereum can be used to replace the function of Kickstarter, as each individual can pledge their ethereum. This ethereum is held and not given to the project owner until the target is met. Hence, the 10% which is given to Kickstarter is saved and the transaction costs involved in pledging for a new product becomes a lot lower using ethereum vs the traditional method.\n"

On these pages, you will have all the time you need.  Just set those websites as \"Allowed Websites\" in the options.  Certain sites such as Facebook and Youtube should be set as \"Blocked Websites\" in the options.  All other websites receive a countdown timer where you must get the information you need before time runs out and the owl closes the page.  \n\nThe owl is very strict.  He will berate and mock you.  You'll be forced to complete tasks to earn break time.  If you do consistent work, use the timeboxing scheduler for work/vacation, and complete the owl's psychological exercises then you might be able to earn the owl's respect.  In version 1.0 no matter what you tried the owl's respect score would not increase.  Now it is technically possible to earn the owl's respect - but highly unlikely. "

    "description": "IRIS Invigilation (IRIS) helps provide educators assurance of assessment integrity during online and remote assessment.\n\nWhat is IRIS?\nIRIS Invigilation (IRIS) is a software program that helps provide educators assurance of assessment integrity during online and remote assessment. IRIS records audio, video, and computer screen activity for the duration of a test/exam. It analyses this information using machine learning and automatically flags potential academic dishonesty through displaying the data in an easy to use reporting dashboard. \n\nHow does IRIS work? \nIRIS records video of a student's face throughout their proctored exam tracking head and eye movement. IRIS records the audio from the student computer’s microphone video from their webcam and takes successive screenshots of what the student is seeing on their computer screen. Facial markers are identified and tracked; categorising and distinguishing innocent behaviours from dishonest behaviours. Educators can then review this data at a time that is convenient to help ensure student identity verification and assessment integrity. \n\nIs it safe for students to share their data? \nIRIS Invigilation software is a safe, secure and necessary method of maintaining academic integrity at a university/institute. The proctoring/invigilation of online assessments is necessary when conducting online learning to ensure educational standards are maintained and to avoid academic dishonesty. Students that share their data are helping to protect the quality and reputation of their institution.   \n\nThe privacy and protection of students and their personal information is paramount. IRIS ensures that data security, protection laws, privacy legislation and regulation are their priority. IRIS uses AWS Cloud Security to protect data and host all data in Sydney, Australia. IRIS does not sell or use any student assessment data; only IRIS technical administrators have access to this for maintenance and security purposes. \n\nIRIS Security Infrastructure: \n•    Two-factor authentication is enabled for the cloud services account that hosts IRIS \n•    Strict firewall schemes protect all IRIS related services to protect user data and prevent nefarious access to the IRIS infrastructure \n•    Only ports and services that need to communicate with each other and to the outside world will be kept open.  These ports/services have strict IP security groups for inbound and outbound traffic \n•    IRIS will never share or sell your personal data to a third party. \n•    Microsoft Edge will ask your permission before installing the IRIS extension on your computer.  \n•    IRIS will only invigilate you during your exam. The permissions you agree to are only for the exam duration.  \n\nPrivacy Policy \nIRIS invigilation values the privacy of its users and is committed to handling their data responsibly and securely. We will never sell any collected data to external parties. All recordings and personal information are solely used for invigilation purposes. All staff and contractors working under IRIS invigilation must comply with Australia’s Privacy Act and this policy. This policy explains how IRIS Invigilation gathers, manages, stores and discards all of the recordings and personal information through our browser extension and website. \n\nInformation we Collect\nUser information request prior to start of invigilation: When the extension is triggered upon accessing the online exam, the student will be required to enter details such as full name and student ID. This is for the assessor to be able to identify if the correct student is sitting for the examination only. Microphone and webcam permissions are requested by the extension at this initial state for the invigilation to be fully performed, which is processed on our servers to catch any suspicious activities and can be reviewed by the assessors. \nA photo of the student’s ID is also taken at the next step. The photo is used to match against the person who is shown on the webcam to make sure no other person is sitting the exam in place of the student. \nAs the invigilation commences, the extension will request to share the student’s screen, which it will start capturing. Throughout the online exam, the audio, webcam and screen will be recorded in accordance to the client institution’s examination regulations and uploaded to IRIS Invigilation’s AWS servers for processing and review. \nLog Data is also captured while the extension is running. Information such as IP address, which web browser and which version, timestamp and which errors have been encountered during the interaction. These details are only used for troubleshooting and maintenance purposes. \nOther hosting regions for data are available for a client upon request, but by default all data is stored and processed in Sydney, Australia. \n\nData Retention \nAll the student recordings are kept on the IRIS Invigilation storage servers for 1 year. Following this period, the client institution can decide to keep copies of the data for safe keeping. IRIS Invigilation will not be held responsible for any mishandling of the data once the recordings are collected by the institute. \n\nSecurity \nEnterprise grade security measures are in place to make sure the IRIS Invigilation servers are protected against data theft or accidental loss. All outgoing and incoming data is made via encrypted (HTTPS) protocol. Firewall and IPS protection have been implemented to prevent attacks, and root access to the servers are only permitted via AWS security groups. \nMonitoring applications keeps logs on any suspicious activities and administrators are notified immediately once detected. \nDaily snapshots of the servers are facilitated for disaster recoveries or any accidental deletion of data.  \n\nContact Information \nIf you have any issues or queries regarding this privacy policy, then please contact us by the information below. \ninfo@irisinvigilation.com \n1300 138 522 \n1031 Wellington St, West Perth WA 6005"

To use the extension, right-click on a PDF link and select the \"Open in PDF viewer\" item. The extension downloads the PDF file in your default downloads directory and then executes the external command to open the downloaded file with the default PDF viewer (e.g. Adobe Acrobat Reader or FoxIt PDF reader).\n\nNote that to execute an OS-level command, you need to install a native client. Native client installation guide appears on the first usage.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Open PDF files from right-click context menu\n2. Transfer already opened PDF files to the external PDF viewer by pressing the browser's action button\n3. Detect PDF links and open them with left-click\n4. Open the external PDF viewer with a user-defined delay\n5. Supports most common PDF viewers\n\nChange Logs:\n0.1.1:\nIt is now possible to define left-click open in default PDF reader from the options page. If this mode is enabled, the extension blocks the default action when a link with the PDF mime type is the target.\n0.1.2:\nIt is possible to ask the extension to send the PDF URL to the external executable. Make sure your PDF Reader can open remote URLs before enabling this option\n0.1.9:\nYou can now run the external executable with a delay. This helps your antivirus application to validate the PDF file before this extension opens it with the external PDF viewer."

It runs only while InPrivate browsing and so doesn't disrupt everyday browsing, but when you really need to bookmark your surprise party plans, et cetera, you can do so easily from the address bar. The next time you're InPrivate browsing, it's then really easy to bring up pages you've bookmarked in the past. You can also easily make multiple sets of bookmarks by choosing a different password for each set.\n\nWe've placed a heavy emphasis on security. Your bookmarks are encrypted using the highest standards before they're stored, so any would-be snoopers will never be able to see what you're actually planning.\n\n--\n\nThanks for checking us out!

It effectively blocks all commercial content on websites, video streaming services (eg. Youtube, Crunchyroll), social networks, etc. You will no longer see any banners, pop-ups or pop-unders, video ads, or autoplay ads. \n\nAdLock adblocking extension protects users’ online privacy and ensures safe and fast browsing on any website. \n\nMain features:\n\nBlock banners and pop-ups \nOur free ad blocker extension removes all pesky adverts. No commercials, pure content only!\n\nBlock video ads\nAdLock shows no mercy to video ads on streaming services including Youtube, Crunchyroll, KissCartoon, and others.\n\nRemove adblock walls (Anti-adblocker detection)\nWebsite owners try their best to protect commercial content from being removed. By using anti-adblocker detection, publishers restrict access to their content to users with ad-blocking software. This is a problem, but not for AdLock as it’s the best ad blocker ninja — unseen and deadly.\n\n\nProtect your online privacy \nStop ads and data collection once and for all. Our lightweight Microsoft Edge extension protects your online privacy. AdLock blocks third party trackers, ad/malware attacks, all forms of online tracking scripts, and bugs run by advertisers like Google, Facebook, etc. No one will be able to track your activities online.\n\nBrowse safely\nAdLock prevents you from visiting malicious websites and protects you against viruses, phishing attacks, and other scams. \n\nAdjust filter list\nYou can adjust the rules (filters) we use to determine what should be blocked on the web pages you visit. Our extension is extremely flexible when it comes to meeting the user’s requirements. No academic degree is required — a walk in the park. \n\nWhitelist any website you wish\nControl your browsing experience: whitelist pages or whole websites when needed, blacklist them again — it’s up to you.\n\nSpeed up page loading time\nAdLock not only removes ads but also gets rid of their placeholders. The web pages look nice and clean, with no empty boxes. Moreover, with AdLock, page loading speed is faster and your overall browsing experience is much smoother. \n\n\nAdLock was designed by users for users. We know your pain, we know you hate digging through tons of ads. You are we.\nThere’s no need to have separate extensions: YouTube adblock, Crunchyroll adblock, etc., AdLock copes with all ad-related problems simultaneously.\nSay goodbye to commercials with the best free Microsoft Edge adblock extension — AdLock.\n\n*Want to block pop-up ads, banners, redirects, and any sort of commercial content on your Android device? \nWant to block ads on your Safari browser?\nNeed more than just an adblock Microsoft Edge extension?\nWe’ve got something for you!\nVisit our official website to find out more.\n\n\nWe welcome feedback, suggestions, and proposals. Feel free to contact us via support@adlock.com and share your thoughts and ideas.\n\n\nImportant!\n\nThe AdLock extension requires such permissions as:\n\n - \"Access data for all websites\": in order to make our product fully functional for your protection from ads.\n - \"Access to browser tabs\" to get information about the website you visit (website url, tab id, parent tab id). It allows us to block annoying ad requests, get rid of ad images and hide empty blocks with special cosmetic and net rules.\n - “Web navigation”: extension watches tab changes and reacts to keep webpage clean from ads.\n\nThe AdLock extension gathers anonymous usage information including browser language, a number of blocked ad requests, stores it on your local storage and doesn’t sell or share it with third parties. The AdLock extension also creates a unique ID and anonymously assigns to each installation. This ID is stored on the AdLock server until you uninstall the AdLock extension.\n"

Generally credible sites get a “Green” rating, meaning they adhere to basic standards of accuracy and transparency. Sites that publish health misinformation such as unproven treatments or bogus medical studies are flagged with a “Red” rating, meaning you should read them with a grain of salt.\n \nEven if you find information on health sites that HealthGuard has identified as generally trustworthy, it’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor about any issues, rather than trusting information you find online. Even accurate information may apply differently to different patients, and there’s no substitute for years of medical training and expertise. The internet should not be your doctor, and neither is HealthGuard.\n \nInstead, think of HealthGuard as a trusty sidekick to keep you away from untrustworthy health advice, and to point you toward more trustworthy sources, as you browse the web. \n \nHealthGuard is for personal use only.

NDS assists you to define rules (recipes) and tasks by using CSS Selectors to identify the element(s) on the HTML pages. Then it scrapes that information as schedule and stores the result in your browser in form of a table which you can export as a CSV or Excel spreadsheet, or save data to Google Sheet directly. NDS supports UTF-8 so it scrapes English,日本語(Japanese),русский(Russian),中文(Chinese),한국어(Korean) with ease.

The color and image are not mutually exclusive.\n\n```\n[profile marketingadmin]\nrole_arn = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/marketingadmin\ncolor = ffaaee\n\n[anotheraccount]\naws_account_id = 987654321987\nrole_name = anotherrole\nregion=ap-northeast-1\n\n[athirdaccount]\naws_account_id = 987654321988\nrole_name = athirdrole\nimage = \"https://via.placeholder.com/150\"\n```\n\n### Complex Configuration\nMore complex configurations involve multiple AWS accounts and/or organizations.\n\n- A profile that has only `aws_account_id` (without a `role_name`) is defined as **base account**.\n\n- **If your account is aliased, the alias will be shown in the role dropdown after 'Account:'.  You MUST use that alias as the aws_account_id for the base account instead of the numerical account id or your configuration won't work as expected.**\n\n- A **target role** is associated with a **base account** by the **target role** specifying a `source_profile`.\n\n- As above, **target roles** can be expressed with a `role_arn` or with both `aws_account_id` and `role_name` and can optionally pass the optional parameters.\n\n- If `target_role_name` is set in **base account**, the value is provided as the default role name for each **target roles**.\n\n```\n[organization1]\naws_account_id = your-account-alias\n\n[Org1-Account1-Role1]\nrole_arn = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/Role1\nsource_profile = organization1\n\n[Org1-Account1-Role2]\naws_account_id = 123456789012\nrole_name = Role2\nsource_profile = organization1\n\n[Org1-Account2-Role1]\naws_account_id = 210987654321\nrole_name = Role1\nsource_profile = organization1\n\n[baseaccount2]\naws_account_id = 000000000000\n\n[Base2-Role1]\nrole_arn = arn:aws:iam::234567890123:role/Role1\nsource_profile = baseaccount2\n\n[AnotherRole]\nrole_name = SomeOtherRole\naws_account_id = account-3-alias\n\n;\n; target_role_name example\n;\n[Org2-BaseAccount]\naws_account_id = 222200000000\ntarget_role_name = Developer\n\n[Org2-Account1-Developer]\naws_account_id = 222200001111\nsource_profile = Org2-BaseAccount\n\n[Org2-Account2-Manager]\naws_account_id = 222200002222\nrole_name = Manager ; overrides target role name\nsource_profile = Org2-BaseAccount\n```\n\nIf you sign-in a base account, target roles of the other base accounts are excluded.\n\nFor more information, please visit the homepage."

This extension has a very simple native component written in c++ that monitors clipboard changes system-wide and notifies the extension about the changes. This way first the extension can monitor clipboard without polling (continuous check with fixed interval) and second it can get notified even if clipboard content is changed by a process out of your browser environment. \n\nNotes:\n1. Each clipboard content can be up to 1Mbytes in size\n2. Each item is being indexed, so it can be searched later. The searching system is very powerful that supports wildcard matching and search operators like \"OR\" and \"AND\"\n3. Each clipboard entry can be pinned to prevent the auto clean-up module from removing it if the total number of clipboards reaches 1000 items.\n4. To search among pinned items append \"keyword:pinned\" to your search query\n5. To move an entry from the UI to the clipboard, press the Enter key or double-click on the entry.\n6. At this point, the extension does not support the automatic insertion of the clipboard content (the c++ component does not support it at this moment)\n7. The c++ component is compiled with https://travis-ci.org/lunu-bounir/clipboard-helper\n8. This extension is meant to replace the need to use native clipboard managers\n9. At this point, only Windows and Mac operating systems are supported. If you can help with the Linux port, please open a GitHub bug report\n10. The extension supports query stemming in 20 languages.\n"

They were fabricated by the long-vanished Forerunners, a species that built worlds, disassembled stars … and was powerless in the face of a parasitic organism known as the Flood. \n\nNow it is up to the Master Chief to ensure they do not fall into the hands of the merciless alien Covenant.\n\nWhether you're a long-time fan or meeting the legendary Spartan super-soldier for the first time, The Master Chief Collection is the definitive Halo gaming experience.\n\nFeaturing Halo: Reach, Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2: Anniversary, Halo 3, Halo 3: ODST, and Halo 4, The Master Chief Collection offers players their own exciting journey through the epic saga. Starting with the incredible bravery of Noble Six in Halo: Reach and ending with the rise of a new enemy in Halo 4, the Master Chief’s story totals 67 campaign missions over six critically-acclaimed titles.\n\nLearn more about Halo: The Master Chief Collection: https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection/windows"

Everything you now type will search through the included indices of the AWS API documentation, although you can also search for aws-cli documentation by prefixing your query with the `@`-sign and through the AWS CloudFormation documentation by prefixing your query with the `:`-sign.\n\nYou can find detailed information in the official README on GitHub: https://github.com/pitkley/aws-search-extension.\n\nAutomatic/manual search-index updates\n=================================\n\nThe AWS search extension uses pre-built indices to provide fast search results without having to perform any network requests.

The latest indices are then downloaded and imported automatically, within a few seconds.\n\nPrivacy\n=================================\n\nThe AWS search extension computes all search-suggestions locally and never sends your queries, or any other data, to any external server!

    "description": "Protect your email communication with end-to-end encryption (PGP). The secure envelope for emails, attachments and files (GDPR).\n\nMailvelope adds additional controls for secure end-to-end email encryption to your webmail client. Thus Mailvelope makes secure email with PGP easy and convenient - also for technical non-experts. Email attachments can be encrypted with just a few clicks.\n\nSecure sending and receiving of emails is not limited to Mailvelope users. By using open standards, Mailvelope is compatible with all other PGP software. A simple setup process leads you directly to the generation of your own PGP key and automatically stores the public part on the Mailvelope key server. From now on, any other Mailvelope user (and many others) can reach you easily and securely without having to exchange the key beforehand.\n\n- Mailvelope offers consistent end-to-end encryption. All operations necessary for encryption and decryption are conducted on your end device. Therefore even the respective webmail provider will never see your messages in plain text.\n\n- The European GDPR demands strict data protection standards for sending personal information for commercial services. With Mailvelope you can easily comply with these requirements.\n\n- Since Mailvelope is compatible with almost all webmail providers, you don't have to change your email address to be able to communicate easily and securely.\nServices like Nextcloud, as well as the email backends of many cloud solutions (Bitrix24, Zoho, etc.) are compatible with Mailvelope and can be activated with a simple click.\n\n- Mailvelope works out of the box with all common webmail providers:\n\n  Gmail\n  GMX\n  WEB.DE\n  Posteo\n  freenet Mail\n  Outlook.com\n  mailbox.org\n  Yahoo!\n\n  Many other email providers and web applications can be easily activated with a single click. Further information can be found at https://www.mailvelope.com/faq\n\nTechnical background\n\n- Mailvelope is Open Source and based on OpenPGP.js (https://openpgpjs.org), an OpenPGP library for JavaScript. The OpenPGP standard (based on PGP, as originally developed by Phil Zimmermann) uses a combination of strong public-key and symmetric encryption to secure electronic communication.\n\n- Thanks to OpenPGP standard compatible with GPG4Win, GPGTools, Enigmail for Thunderbird, Protonmail, OpenKeyChain and many more.\n\n- For both encryption and decryption, Mailvelope does not need the help of a server. Since all encryption operations are performed on your end device, your private key never leaves your end device, as is the case with many popular PGP cloud solutions.\nMailvelope uses a secure editor for entering and displaying your messages which is displayed in a separate browser window. Your email provider will never have access to the plain text of your messages.\n\n- In the years since 2013, Mailvelope has undergone several extensive security audits. A list can be found here: https://github.com/mailvelope/mailvelope/wiki/Security\n\n- For the attack scenario known as \"Efail\" in 2018, Mailvelope proved to be largely resistant. (See: https://www.mailvelope.com/en/blog/implications-efail-on-mailvelope)\n\n- Since Mailvelope is open source software, the source code is open for inspection. This ensures that Mailvelope only does what it is supposed to do.\n\nWebsite: https://www.mailvelope.com\nSource code: https://github.com/mailvelope/mailvelope\nDocumentation: https://www.mailvelope.com/en/faq\nQuick Start Guide: https://www.mailvelope.com/en/help\n\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/mailvelope\n"

It contains a master playlist with the \".m3u8\" file extension. First, the extension downloads the master playlist, and then within the master, it finds playlist content. Each playlist has several fragmented items. All items are displayed in the UI with a download and a remove button. When you press the download button the extension downloads all fragmented media and merges them all to generate a single media file. \n\nNote 1: the interface for the extension can be opened in a new tab or a separate window. Please right-click on the toolbar button to choose the appropriate context. Within the UI, there is a toggle button to turn the addon ON or OFF.\n\nNote 2: HLS Downloader is NOT responsible for media content that you download with this add-on. We strongly recommend that you verify the related media copyright permissions on each website before downloading any media file(s).\n\nNote 3: to download the HLS stream you gave 3 options. (1) To add a stream URL manually, please enter the desired URL with the \".m3u8\" file extension in the UI. (2) As you browse the internet, this extension monitors the webpages and captures all HLS media files, and if anything is found, automatically downloads the playlist and updates the badge number accordingly (only when the addon is turned ON). The 3rd option for downloading the HLS stream is via the context-menu item. Please right-click on \".m3u8\" streams and then select - Download with HLS Downloader - from the context menu.\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill out the bug report form on the add-on's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/hls-downloader.html)."

This extension enables the user to adjust the current window's layout size based on the pre-defined set or any new custom dimension. Each dimension is visually shown in a toolbar popup for easy access. The extension gets left, top, right, and bottom positions in percent unit and changes the window size to these values. This extension detects all the monitors in your system and allows one of the monitors to be the reference for the alignment. Also, this extension supports keyboard shortcuts for the first six alignments in the popup. It means that you can re-align to any of these six alignments without opening the popup and just by pressing a user-defined keyboard set. Each item in the popup is draggable. The user can change the arrangement of the items or even remove or add new items.\n\nNote: This extension uses a non-persistent background script to be completely idle when it is not active\n\nAs of version 0.1.4, you can define a custom window size for the startup. Once the extension loads, it sets this user-defined window size for the currently active window."

Word banks provide core vocabulary that can be used for vocabulary development, spelling support, to gain the gist of an article, aide in recalling previously learned words, and can be used to help support writing.   Word Bank also summarizes and extracts important people, places, a timeline, and numbers from web pages.  \n\nCreate a word bank with a click of a button of any materials or articles online.  The key vocabulary of the website you are on will instantly be made into a word bank, a summary is built, and people, places and times/numbers are extracted.  Or… simply search over 5+ million topics to extract and create a word bank of that topic.  \n\nTo use the word bank in your writing, hover over the words and listen to them out loud.  If you’d like to enter that word into your writing, there’s no need to retype, just click on it, and it will be inserted wherever your cursor is placed.  \n\nDepending on your purpose, you can adjust the word bank’s layout.  If you’d like to use it for writing and finding words, an Alphabetic layout supports finding words easily.  If you’d like a word bank to obtain the gist of an article and the most important vocabulary used, then a Circular layout will place the most important words in the middle and less important words towards the outside.  \n\nTry it for free and see if it works for you.  Pricing and more information can be viewed at https://wordbank.io\n\nQuestions/Help can be found at http://help.donjohnston.net\n\nIf you already have an account for Word Bank Universal, you can manage it at https://wordbank.io"

    "description": "Windscribe helps you mask your physical location, circumvent censorship, and block ads and trackers on websites you use every day\n\nWindscribe is a VPN desktop application and proxy browser extension that work together to block ads, trackers, restore access to blocked content and help you safeguard your privacy online. Free plan provides 10 GB of data per month (if you confirm your email address), and the Pro plan has unlimited data and access to servers in over 110 cities in 63 countries.\n\nStill not convinced? Perhaps this elegant list of features will convince you otherwise.\n\nBrowse Privately\n-------------------------\nGovernments block content based on your location. Corporations track and sell your personal data. Add Windscribe to your browser and take back control of your privacy.\n\nAdvanced Privacy Features\n-------------------------\nWindscribe is not just a proxy extension. It's a suite of privacy tools which include:\n\n* Ad + Tracker Blocking - Ads and trackers follow you around, waste your bandwidth and compromise your privacy. Windscribe will block all this crap.\n\n* Malware Blocking - Some sites distribute malware. We'll prevent you from ever ending up on those sites.\n\n* Social Blocking - Social networks are the biggest privacy invaders out there. Block their trackers.\n\n* Whitelisting - Our block lists are not one size fits all. Customize your experience.\nLocation API Spoofing - Sites can request your GPS location why bypasses most proxies and VPNs. Not with Windscribe.\n\n* WebRTC Blocking - Prevents WebRTC leaks that plague most proxy extensions and VPNs.\n\n* Timezone Spoofing - Sites can detect that your IP doesn't match your browser's time zone. This feature solves this problem.\n\n* Language Spoofing - This feature will spoof your browser's language settings to match the proxy location of your choice.\n\n* Notification Blocking - Tired for sites asking you to send notifications? We are too. Enable this feature to never see those things again.\n\n* User Agent Spoofing - Helps combat browser fingerprinting\n\n* Cookie Monitoring - Leave nothing behind. This feature deletes 1st or 3rd party cookies when you close the tab.\n\nUnlock content\n--------------------------\nWindscribe VPN masks your IP address. This gives you unrestricted and private access to entertainment, news sites, and blocked content in over 63 different countries.\n\nNo identifying logs\n-------------------------\nYour privacy is a right. We don’t track you. We don't sell your data to marketers, or even share it with anyone. We don’t keep logs that can deanonymize you. You can use Windscribe without any personal details. \n\nGo beyond basic protection\n-------------------------\nFor comprehensive privacy protection even outside of the browser, use our desktop VPN applications (they’re also free). Available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Did we mention mobile? Yeah, there's mobile apps too.\n\nWe got your back\n-------------------------\nHaving issues with Windscribe VPN or want to suggest something? Send us a support ticket: https://windscribe.com/support/ticket\n\nOpen source\n-------------------------\nThe ad and tracker blocking functionality is powered by the uBlock Origin project. You can find the complete source code for this extension here: https://github.com/Windscribe/browser-extension"

    "description": "Find relevant information even faster. By using the SABIO Integrator, you can now access the knowledge from your SABIO Knowledge database directly when using other websites.\n\nWhat is the SABIO Integrator?\n\nThe SABIO Integrator is a browser plugin that can be integrated into (almost) every web application. With the Integrator, it is possible to display knowledge from SABIO directly in a web application, so that application-specific integrations do not have to be developed anymore.\n\nThe SABIO Integrator can read specific areas of web applications and perform targeted searches based on this data. This enables knowledge from SABIO to be displayed exactly where it is needed without context changes. The required information is actively displayed in the respective browser tab without having to search for it.\n\nHow is the integrator applied?\n\n- With the SABIO Integrator, knowledge content from the linked SABIO system can be quickly searched and displayed. This is useful, for example, when a user wants to briefly look up a search word in SABIO from a website.\n\n- The function \"Search with SABIO Integrator\" offers the possibility to mark one or more words on a website and to search for this or these words in the SABIO system by right-clicking on the option \"Search with SABIO Integrator\" in the context menu.\n\n- The SABIO Integrator informs the user about new, unconfirmed messages in the SABIO System. The SABIO Integrator icon in the browser bar displays the number of unconfirmed SABIO messages for the user. The displayed number disappears as soon as all messages are confirmed or the user logs off in the SABIO Integrator.\n\nWhat are the advantages of using the Integrator?\n\nKnowledge from SABIO is displayed without the user having to actively  search for it.\nThe required information is displayed within the current context, i.e. in the same browser window.\nSince no context change is necessary, the readiness to use SABIO increases and the service quality and processing speed increases as well.\nFurthermore, the effort needed for the integration of SABIO Knowledge content into web-based tools is reduced significantly.\n\n\nWhat are the requirements for using the integrator?\n\n- An existing SABIO system\n- Using Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser\n- The SABIO Integrator is available in German and English."

The result is a seamless and intuitive experience, where you can highlight as well as copy and paste and even edit and translate the text formerly trapped within an image.\n\nWords on the web exist in two forms: there’s the text of articles, emails, tweets, chats and blogs— which can be copied, searched, translated, edited and selected— and then there’s the text which is shackled to images, found in comics, document scans, photographs, posters, charts, diagrams, screenshots and memes. Interaction with this second type of text has always been a second class experience, the only way to search or copy a sentence from an image would be to do as the ancient monks did, manually transcribing regions of interest.\n\nYou can watch as moving your cursor over a block of words changes it into the little I-beam. You can drag over a few lines and watch as a semitransparent blue box highlights the text, helping you keep track of where you are and what you’re reading. Hit Ctrl+C to copy the text, where you can paste it into a search bar, a Word document, an email or a chat window. Right-click and you can erase the words from an image, edit the words, or even translate it into a different language.\n\nSecurity & Privacy: Project Naptha handles OCR and text detection locally on your computer. When highlighting text, the extension checks a remote server to determine whether a public high quality transcription exists using a cryptographic hash of the URL (this includes no cookies, user tokens, or any identifying information, and the server is incapable of storing access logs). For more information, read the section on security and privacy on http://projectnaptha.com/"

You can:\n\n    Remove, Move, Color the link of the webpage in the search result.\n    Remove, Make the Ads stand out(make ad more obvious, make ad really obvious).\n    Remove Emojis from titles and descriptions of search results.\n    Remove other stuff Google inserts in the search results(“People also ask”, “Top News”, …).\n\n\n\nWhy I made it?\n\nSome time ago Google changed how their search results appear. Ads use to be obvious compared to regular search results.\n\nAfter the update, it is way harder to tell the difference between an ad and a genuine search result. What Google is trying to do here is increase the CTR for their ads by trying to blend them in with the regular search results.\n\nCompared to how Google Search results looked years ago there are now fewer results per page and the pages contain a bunch of other clutter that you might or might not find useful.\n\nI don’t really appreciate how they have changed the search results in the past years. If you don’t either you can use this extension I made to clean them up.\n\nI didn’t make this extension for profit. As mentioned above I made this extension because I didn’t appreciate the new look of the Google search results and I knew there were a lot of people who didn’t either.\n\nI also thought this would be a good opportunity to learn how to make a web browser extension and document the progress on my blog(You can find source code my Github page). The extension is free and will continue to remain so. Feel free to copy any of the code or fork the project and make your own version of the extension with other/different features.\n\n\n\nPrivacy and Guarantees\n\nThe extension doesn’t collect any information at all. It only saves the setting you choose in the extension and saves it in your browser(Feel free to look at the code.).\n\nI make no guarantees that this extension will be without bugs or that I will keep updating it. Bugs can be reported on the projects Github page."

You might be wondering what it is but let me keep it simple, it is basically a group of clocks or an online world map displaying the city and their current time or a list of different cities showing the time and date.\n\nKeeping track of the current local time of several cities has become much easier with the use of the world clock. Unlike before, we still need to add or subtract a certain number manually from your current time. But now, it has become hassle-free.\n\nIf you are constantly on the move every day, going from one country to another, then perhaps the internet is the best way for you to check the world clock. A simple click will show the time difference in between cities. For example, you left your country at eight o’clock in the morning for another country with a different time zone. For sure, you will be confused by the time difference, thus having this online tool will minimize your confusion with time and will make your travel much easier.\n\nTry it here on our website and for sure you will be amazed by the benefits that they provide.

Automatic scrobbling takes place 30 seconds after the music is played or at the end of the track if the track is less than 30 seconds. You can also manually scrobble the currently played song by pressing the count-down label.\n\nUsing this extension you can also like or dislike YouTube songs without the need to open the actual \"Last.fm\" website.\n\nNote that to prevent unwanted scrobbling, the extension pauses the count down when the song is paused. Also, the scrobbling label, as well as the like button, only appears if you are watching a track in the \"Music\" or \"Entertainment\" categories. Of course, the user can extend categories to include localized names or completely remove the category check.\n\nUsage Instruction:\n1. Install the extension\n2. Open a YouTube music or refresh an existing music tab\n3. Wait for the extension to show \"Connect to Last.fm\"\n\nFeatures:\n1. Supports Love/unlove tracks\n2. Supports automatic artist name detection\n3. Supports cleaning the track extra info\n4. Supports manually modifying the track name or artist name (if the song doesn't get recognized)\n5. Supports reporting the currently playing track to \"Last.fm\"\n6. Supports YouTube Music interface\n\nWhy do I need this extension?\nIf you enjoy watching music videos, this extension helps you to discover new music tracks. The \"Last.fm\" service suggests new music tracks based on your listening habits.\n\nWhat is the \"Last.fm\" service? [from Wikipedia]\nLast.fm is a music website founded in the United Kingdom in 2002. Using a music recommender system called \"Audioscrobbler\", Last.fm builds a detailed profile of each user's musical taste by recording details of the tracks the user listens to, either from Internet radio stations, or the user's computer or many portable music devices. This information is transferred (\"scrobbled\") to Last.fm's database either via the music player (including, among others, Spotify, Deezer, Tidal, MusicBee, SoundCloud, and Anghami) or via a plug-in installed into the user's music player. The data is then displayed on the user's profile page and compiled to create reference pages for individual artists."

This addon, when enabled, can successfully block all ping requests. Toolbar icon changes color when you click on it. The red color is when the addon is active and the grey color is for the inactive state. \n\nWithin the add-on options page, there are several settings to adjust. You can choose which type of ping request to block via the first three options. Next, there is a console log error checkbox (to log blocked URLs to the browser's console). The last setting is for adding domains to be whitelisted. All entries should be comma-separated.\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/ping-blocker.html)."

    "description": "Hey! Seen the terrific rating above? You must be wondering: “Is it finally a good popup blocker? Should I try it?” Let’s read the description to find out if there is something interesting about it and if so, give it a try.\n\nSo, answering your questions: “No and Yes” - it isn’t some “good” popup blocker. PopUpOFF is brilliant: https://github.com/RomanistHere/PopUpOFF/issues/16 - and you should definitely try it if you ever struggled with popups, cookie notifications, overlays and other nasty things.\n\nWhy?\n\n- PopUpOFF doesn’t just block some popups that other developers paid for, but YOU are in control of it. You decide not to have any single overlay on the screen or casually remove only the most annoying things (hi cookie notifications and subscription popups). \n- You can unlock and read PAID content FOR FREE on some websites (see the video above). \n- Size of this extension is 100 times less than any other average popup blocker in the store. Size doesn’t matter? Well… I’m not so sure.\n- PopUpOFF is a non-commercial and open-source project. It means no ads, no tracking, everything it has is available for you for free and forever. I am RomanistHere and I’m giving you this piece of better web. \n\nDrawbacks?\n\n- It still is in development, so there could be bugs or imperfect solutions, I’m working on it solo and there are other things in the world to do. So be gentle, I created it for myself back then, but now I’m doing it for you.\n- PopUpOFF is as addictive as it gets. After you start using it, there would be no way back. You are warned:)\n\nSounds interesting? Go get it. Write “hello” to me, share the feedback. Check what else I’m doing. There are probably other pieces of better web. Be cool, be gentle, help me make the world better. Not saying goodbye. Have a better life now:)\n\nUseful links:\n\nGitHub (tech description): https://github.com/RomanistHere/PopUpOFF\nWhy am I doing this: https://romanisthere.github.io/posts/my-mission/\nChangelog: https://romanisthere.github.io/apps/popupoff/updates/\nStay updated on my projects: https://twitter.com/RomanistHere\nDonate: https://www.donationalerts.com/r/romanisthere "

This behavior can be controlled in the extension settings.\n\nSince Chromium based browsers do not provide an option to read the certificate from the webRequest-API, a server component is needed in order for Chexxo to function properly. Therefore, we have written a simple server which provides the extension with the certificate for the requested webpage.  You may host this server yourself, see https://github.com/Chexxo/Server for more information.\n\nPrivacy:\nThe server only gets the URL of the webpage which should be checked. The server logs only contain the URL, a UUID and the error if one occurred. The UUID is newly generated for every occurring error and cannot be traced back to a user unless you provide us with your local log for debugging purposes. This does not happen automatically therefore by default we cannot associate a URL with a user."

These websites do not have any screenshot included.\n\nNote 2: all cells within the speed dial UI are drag-able. Simply drag and drop the cell to your desired location; all cells will be reordered automatically and save to the memory.\n\nNote 3: Speed Dial add-on, does NOT change the look of the new tab in your browser. It just adds a stand-alone page rendered with Speed Dial UI.\n\nNote 4: use the keyboard shortcut (Alt + Shift + A) to add desired pages to the speed dial.\n\nNote 5: (v0.1.8) use the toolbar button's context menu item to add the current tab or, all tabs, to the speed dial automatically. If you choose all tabs, the extension will ask for broad host permission.\n\nNote 6: if you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill the bug report form in the add-on's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/speed-dial.html)."

    "description": "VideoSkip allows you to filter out several types of objectionable content from video streams. It uses the same categories as the \"Parents Guide\" section of IMDB.com. It can skip sections entirely, or simply mute the sound or blank the video, at your discretion. Because it does not modify the videos in any way, but rather plays them selectively, it does not infringe media copyrights.\n\nStep by step:\n\n1. Load the video from a streaming service normally and begin play so it loads some data (not full-screen), then stop it and click the VideoSkip icon on the upper-right of the browser. A new window will appear next to the video. You can move it, or resize it like a regular page with Ctrl + or Ctrl -.\n\n2. If you have a .skp file containing the skips, you can load it now with the \"Load skip file\" button. Once loaded, its contents will appear in a box on the \"Edit\" tab. There is a growing number of skip files for popular films at the VideoSkip Exchange, loaded by a button on the interface.\n\n3. If the skip file has been previously synced with your video service, you will be taken to the \"Filter\" tab so you can set the filter strengths as described in the next step. Otherwise, you'll be taken to the \"Sync\" tab. There, you will be asked to scrub the video with the arrow buttons until it looks okay again. When the screenshot finally matches the video, click \"Sync times\" to sync everything for your service. A new version of the skip file will be made so the people you share it with can skip this step from now on.\n\n4. Set the category filters using the sliders, according to the audience. The higher, the more stringent the filter. High = for children, Medium = for teens, Low = for adults. If a filter is Off, the flagged content will be shown.\n\n5. Start the video from its own page, sit back, and enjoy. Skips will take place when their time arrives. A message will appear on the fullscreen video when you move the mouse, telling you which filters are engaged.\n\nYou can make your own skip files and share them with your friends freely. They will work even if the videos being played are from a different source. The skip file exchange is located at https://videoskip.org/exchange\n\nThere's also a standalone web app, which works with videos that you have saved to your computer. Get it at https://videoskip.org/app for computers, or https://videoskip.org/mobile for mobile devices.\n\nLegal Notice: Content copyright owners and distributors are hereby informed that users and developers of this software are exercising their right of free speech, guaranteed by law in many nations, by voluntarily refraining from seeing or hearing content without modifying said content in any way.

A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached A QR code uses four standardized encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji) to store data efficiently.\n\nWhat is a barcode?\nA barcode or bar code is a method of representing data in a visual, machine-readable form. Initially, barcodes represented data by varying the widths and spacings of parallel lines. These barcodes, now commonly referred to as linear or one-dimensional (1D), can be scanned by special optical scanners, called barcode readers, of which there are several types. Later, two-dimensional (2D) variants were developed, using rectangles, dots, hexagons, and other geometric patterns, called matrix codes or 2D barcodes, although they do not use bars as such."

    "description": "Tired of searching through squished tab icons to find that one tab you are sure is there?\nWith TabMerger you can simplify this clutter while greatly increasing productivity in a highly organized and customizable fashion!\n\nWith a single click, you can have all your tabs in a single place, where you can then re-arrange them into appropriate groups, delete extra/unwanted tabs, customize group colors, and so much more. All tabs that are merged into TabMerger are stored internally for you to use at a later time, even when you close the browser window. Lots of analytics are provided to keep you informed about the state of your tabs.\n\nIn addition to reducing the heavy tab clutter, TabMerger significantly reduces the memory usage of your machine as on average each chrome tab can use 25MB-100MB of RAM. These add up quickly if left open and can significantly slow down your machine, but with TabMerger you simply have a list of tabs which can be re-opened when you really need them.\n\nTabMerger is also Open Source (https://github.com/lbragile/TabMerger), under GPLv3 license, with a growing community of passionate users who aim to make the product better every day. This guarantees that TabMerger is safe, secure, and up to par with user's recommendations/needs.\n\n——————————\n😍 FEATURES 😍 \n——————————\n✅ Global\n🔹 Walkthrough Tutorial: Helps users who need details clarified.\n🔹 Filters: Allows users to search for tabs using \"smart\" filters to quickly find that buried tab. Can be used to search by group name for groups of tabs or directly for a tab using its title.\n🔹 Dark Mode: Toggle switch to active/deactivate TabMerger's dark mode. In dark mode all text is light and background is dark providing high contrast.\n🔹 Print PDF: Generates a print friendly PDF document consisting of basic information and hyperlinks to the user's tabs. This is great when the user simply wants to share their accumulated tab links with others who might not have TabMerger installed.\n🔹 Open All: Opens every tab from every group in the order that they appear.\n🔹 Delete All: Deletes all the tabs from every group (also, deletes all the groups leaving only one default group).\n🔹 Export/Import JSON: Saves TabMerger's current configuration as a JSON file. This is useful to restore information directly into TabMerger (using \"Import JSON\") or sharing with others so that they can be on the same page.\n🔹 Syncing: Ability to use TabMerger across your devices by uploading its configuration using the browser's built in \"sync\" mechanism. \n🔹 Undo Action: Accidently deleted a group or tab? No worries, you have a chance to undo that mishap.\n🔹 Add Group: Allows the user to add groups where tabs can be sorted accordingly.\n\n❕ Note that the total number of tabs merged into TabMerger are displayed at the top of the sidebar and in the extension icon (if enabled in settings).\n\n✅ Groups\n🔹 Move Group: Provides drag and drop operation on a group-level. This allows the user to quickly sort their tabs based on which groups they are in.\n🔹 Lock/Unlock Group: Locked groups will never be deleted/removed to prevent unwanted data loss. You can always unlock a group by clicking on the lock again.\n🔹 Star/Unstar Group: Have a group of tabs which you really like? Star them to automatically move them to the top of TabMerger's page and lock them. This group can then be unstarred at any time.\n🔹 Edit Group Title: Allows the user to edit the group's title. This is useful to name groups meaningful names according to the tabs inside.\n🔹 Pick Group Color: Provides customization for the background color of the group through an easy and intuitive color picker. Additionally, preset colors are provided to ease the color picking process.\n🔹 Merge ALL: Merges all the tabs in your current window and displays them in TabMerger at the corresponding group.\n🔹 Merge LEFT: Merges all the tabs in your current window to the left of the current active tab and displays them in TabMerger at the corresponding group.\n🔹 Merge RIGHT: Merges all the tabs in your current window to the right of the current active tab and displays them in TabMerger at the corresponding group. \n🔹 Hide Tabs: Hides every tab in the given group, these are still tallied and \"visible\" to TabMerger (just not to the user). Useful when you want to save space for less relevant groups.\n🔹 Open Group: Opens all the tabs in the corresponding group ordered as they appear.\n🔹 Delete Group: Deletes all the tabs in the corresponding group, along with the group item itself - as long as the group is not locked.\n\n❕ Note that each group has a \"Created\" timestamp to let users know how old each group is.\nAdditionally, each group title has a counter indicating the number of tabs in the group.\n\n✅ Tabs\nEach tab is moveable within its own group and can:\n🔹 Drag & drop from the URL address bar lock icon directly into TabMerger.\n🔹 Deleted via the \"x\" button.\n🔹 Be moved from one group to another using the \"grid\" icon. \n🔹 Opened by LEFT clicking on the title.\n🔹 Edited by MIDDLE clicking on the title.\n🔹 Pinned/unpinned inside of TabMerger which persists when the tab is restored.\n\n✅ Settings\nHere users can do the following:\n🔹 Change the default group title and color.\n🔹 Include a list of websites which they prefer not to have merged into TabMerger.\n🔹 Decide if they want the extension badge icon to display relevant group/tab information.\n🔹 Enable merging of tabs as TabMerger is opened.\n🔹 Have merged tabs remain open or close them.\n🔹 Set merging behavior for pinned tabs.\n🔹 Choose whether restored tabs are kept in TabMerger or not.\n\n✅ Context Menu\nIf you right click anywhere on an active tab's page, you can access extra TabMerger functionality. These include the Merge ALL Tabs, Merge LEFT Tabs, and Merge RIGHT Tabs features described above, as well as the following.\n🔹 Open TabMerger: In case you want to simply open the TabMerger extension page without merging any tabs in the current window.\n🔹 Merge ONLY: to simply merge the current active tab, without touching the rest.\n🔹 Merge EXCLUDING: to merge all tabs other than the current active tab.\n🔹 Exclude site from TabMerger's visibility: Updates the appropriate settings field with this tab's link. This can be seen as a shortcut to avoid having to type the link from memory (or copy/pasting) if the tab is already open.\n🔹 Instructions: Direct link to TabMerger's instructions page (this one).\n🔹 Contact Us: Direct link to TabMerger's contact page, incase a user has any questions or inquiries.\n\n✅ Keyboard Shortcuts\nTabMerger additionally has keyboard shortcuts for each important feature. For example, to merge all your tabs, a user can simply press \"Alt + A\" on any window. Each user can manually set these shortcuts at edge://extensions/shortcuts.\n\n🌟 There are many more features that we plan to implement and we would love to incorporate any feedback provided by our users. \n\n————————————————\n🔐 PRIVACY & SECURITY 🔐\n————————————————\nYour privacy and security is of utmost concern for us at TabMerger.

    "description": "With Virtual Piano you can experience playing the piano on your computer\nAre you among those individuals who love to play the piano yet are not anymore able to do so because of certain situations that hinder you from exercising your hobbies? Then perhaps this virtual piano could be of great help. It is basically a simulation of the real piano wherein you can still access all the available functions yet in a different manner since this is an online application, therefore, you can use either a computer or a mobile phone. \n\nWhen using a computer, you can play the piano using the mouse and/or the keyboard. It might be quite awkward at first but you will get used to it if you constantly practice. However, if you use a mobile phone, then you will be using your fingers to touch the screen of your cell phone while playing the app. \n\nAlthough it might be a little different than the traditional piano, its purpose and functions remain the same and that is to improve and develop your piano skills as well as for fun and entertainment. The keys in the real piano are practically the same with that of the virtual piano.\n\nMany people enjoy playing the virtual piano, most especially during their leisure time. Because not only do they have fun, they also get to improve their skills and learn more about the instrument and music. Through this, they can expand their knowledge and meet new acquaintances who are also enjoying the use of this application.\n\nThe virtual piano is an online application wherein you can simulate playing a real piano. There are those which are available online wherein you will need an internet connection to be able to access it. However, it is also available for download and can be installed on your computer or cell phone so that you can access it anywhere and anytime you feel like playing the piano.\n\nJust like the physical and real piano, this virtual piano allows you to play about anything. Whatever music or songs you want to play can be done using this application. \n\nHowever, it may be a little different in a manner especially if you are using a computer because you will be using a mouse to click each key. It may be quite difficult but constant practice will make you accustomed. But if you are using a touchscreen tablet or cell phone then playing it would be quite similar with that of the normal piano since you will be using your fingers to press the keys.\n\nAn application virtual piano is a perfect tool for those who love to play the piano but are always on the move and does not have extra time to stay and sit in from of the piano itself. With this application, you can now play the piano at your spare time wherever you are. You will be enjoying the same perks as that of normal pianists since you will be able to play your favorites songs with it."

    "description": "A Christmas Carol. In Prose. Being a Ghost Story of Christmas, commonly known as A Christmas Carol, is a novella by Charles Dickens, first published in London by Chapman & Hall in 1843 and illustrated by John Leech. A Christmas Carol recounts the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, an elderly miser who is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley and the spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come. After their visits, Scrooge is transformed into a kinder, gentler man.\n\nDickens wrote A Christmas Carol during a period when the British were exploring and re-evaluating past Christmas traditions, including carols, and newer customs such as Christmas trees. He was influenced by the experiences of his own youth and by the Christmas stories of other authors, including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged School, one of several establishments for London's street children. The treatment of the poor and the ability of a selfish man to redeem himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character are the key themes of the story.\n"

    "description": "About this Add-on:\nUsing computer algorithms, No Homo Graph checks in real-time to see if websites you visit are spelled similar to a user-defined list of domains. If similar matches (a.k.a. homo-graphs) are found, a modal dialog is shown preventing you from interacting with the website until you indicate awareness of the risks involved. The modal dialog is modal to the website only and doesn't prevent you from switching tabs or replacing it with another website altogether. The user-defined list of domains is populated with popular domains like PayPal, Western Union, Google, Yahoo, MyEtherWallet and MoneyGram and the user is free to add and remove from the list.\n\nFor example, it will catch things like \"paypaᶘ.com\" if you have \"paypal.com in your list.\n\nHow No Homo Graph Works:\nWhen you visit a website, this add-on parses the second-level and third-level domain from the URL and calculates the difference between them and the domains in your user-defined list. If the domains are puny-code encoded, they will be converted to Unicode. If the domains contain Cyrillic characters that look like Ascii characters, they will be converted into Ascii. If the difference is below a threshold (2 permutations if the domain is less than 7 characters excluding the TLD), it will alert the user that a match was found.\n\nWhat are the Limitations?:\nThis add-on is not fool-proof. An attacker can simply make more changes to the domain until it is different enough. But then it becomes easier to spot with the naked eye.\n\nHow is my Information Stored?:\nAll info is stored locally on your computer.\n\nWhat are Homo-Graph Attacks?:\nSee these links:\nhttps://slashdot.org/story/02/05/28/0142248/spoofing-urls-with-unicode\nhttps://dev.to/loganmeetsworld/homographs-attack--5a1p\n\nExample attacks:\nhttps://xn--80aa0cbo65f.com (fake paypal.com)\nhttps://www.xn--80ak6aa92e.com (fake apple.com)\nhttp://www.xn--o1aae.com (fake cnn.com)"

    "description": "dflibg/js dfirefly is an SDK for dataflow applications built using the dflibg/js library.\ndfirefly SDK includes panels to inspect dataflow components (datastreams, connections, etc.), monitor datastreams, set dataflow thread breakpoints, audit and analyze the compiled application (dataflow lint, cluster-analysis, dataflow graphing) and a dataflow log/console.\n\nWHAT ARE dflibg/js-BASED APPLICATIONS -\n\ndflibg/js-based dataflow applications are built around \n    - datastreams,  \n    - the nodes that generate and observe them,  attach those datastreams to \n         document objects, servers, proxies, windows, datastores, etc.,\n    - the dataflow engines (modules) built from them, [including general modules, dynamic\n         server and re-usable dataflow library modules]\n    - datastores to which datastreams may be sourced and sinked passively or reactively, and \n    - instantiable models - from which a document or sections of it may be composed -\n         models integrate document section prototypes (templates), an initiator dataflow \n         engine to initialize the prototype when attaching a copy to the DOM,  a\n        CodeBehind controller module for those model instances, a private datastore\n        per model instance and a separate datastore shared by all instances of that model.\n\nWHAT IS THE dflibg/js SDK / WHAT CAN IT DO -\n\nTOOLS:\n\ndfirefly - examine/inspect:  has 4 sub-panels:\n    examine - inspects modules, nodes, their datastreams and dataflows.\n    packages - inspects models/model instances, datastores and datastore views.\n    connections - examines datastream connections with the document and datastores - datastream sources and\n        their dataflows into the dataflow engines, and document elements/properties to which datastreams are attached.\n    networks - inspects streams and dialogues: client datastreams - datastreams directed\n        to another module, window, tab; streams - conduits for datastreams negotiated\n        between modules, windows, and even an application and an extension; proxies -\n        nodes whose promise is a stand-in for a remote server, a promise for a dialogue\n        with another module, application, etc.\ndfirefly - watch:\n    monitor individual datastreams - browse the dataflow graph/tree and select individual\n    datastreams to watch live.\ndfirefly - debug:\n    browse and set dataflow breakpoints in the application; step through and over dataflow\n    propagations; examine the state of all components in the dataflow event thread.\n\ndfirefly - audit:  \n    create and examine dataflow lint reports for individual  modules and the application.\n    generate an unresolved references report.\ndfirefly - analyze:\n    visualize dataflow - generate dataflow graphs showing how data flows through the\n        application - from where it originates to how it effects document elements, datastores,\n        and more; selectively show data sources, sinks, data inheritance, etc.\n    map dataflow - generate a dataflow cluster analysis and a DOT language representation.\n    profile - (preliminary) - generate a module-relative computational cost analysis.\ndfirefly - console:\n    although the console can not yet poke at and modify dataflow, it does include a \n    dataflow log 'drawer' (that can be opened in any panel).  the dataflow log shows\n    compilation messages, warnings and errors from the library.\n\nHOW DO I LEARN MORE -\n    \nAdditional overview information is available by opening www.dflibg.org/sdkfirefly.html**\nThis shows dfirefly's panels / overview documentation / panel detail nodes, etc.,\nbut without any content (since it is not connected as an extension to a web page). \nCheck out the overview menu item in the debug panel as an introduction as to what is possible with a dataflow breakpoint debugger (including a semi-live sample).\n\nBecause dflibg/js dfirefly is itself written as a dflibg/js-based dataflow application, dfirefly can be\nbe used to inspect dfirefly's front-end, sdkfirefly.html.  Explore / inspect -\n\n    install the extension and then open sdkfirefly.html.  The dfirefly page-action icon will\n    appear.  Click on that icon and see a demonstration of the SDK live."

In other words, you can create your own social media rolodex!\n\nYou can also perform searches on this rolodex, and find people based on the categories, tasks, notes and fields you assigned to them. You can even export your social media rolodex as an Excel spreadsheet.\n\nCurrently, it works on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News and Eksi Sozluk but we'll keep adding support for other social media sites.\n\nYou can categorize your social feeds / friends and add colorful tags to their posts so that they would stand out on your timeline. It is super easy and fun to use. \n\nIt is totally free!

Some websites prevent right-click to prohibit the user from copying or pasting content. This is a misuse of a browser feature that is designed to allow website owners to provide their own context menu not to block the user from accessing the browser's default context. \n\nHow to use the extension?\nSimply click on the toolbar button if the right-click is blocked on a website. That's it! Note that this extension uses a non-persistent background script which means it is not using any resource unless the toolbar button is pressed. So compared to the other alternatives it can be considered more efficient implementation.\n\nSome extra use cases:\n1. Copy image from image hosting websites such as Instragram (www.instagram.com) or 500px (500px.com).\n2. Copy video from video or clip hosting websites such as Instragram or Tik Tak (www.tiktok.com).\n\nFeatures:\n1. Reenables defualt context menu based on the context (for image, you will get image context menu, and for video, you will get the default video context menu with \"Save As\" context menu item)\n2. Reenables copy and paste on websites that prevert them (unblocks clipboard)\n3. One-click toggle on and off\n4. Automatically gets enabled on the user requested websites\n5. Disables web distraction by muting \"window.alert\" and other intruptting notifications\n6. Unblocks text selection (\"user-select\", \"-moz-user-select\",  and \"-webkit-user-select\")\n7. Unblocks pointer event blocking (\"pointer-events\")\n8. Unblocks image access within HTML5's custom elements\n9. Open-source on GitHub"

It's also compatible with the AutoPagerize Database, which means it supports thousands of websites automatically. Infy supports 4 different actions and 4 different append modes so you can customize each site's infinite scrolling to how you want it to be. Infy understands both CSS Selector and XPath expressions for finding next links, and it features an Element Picker that can generate them for you, similar to the original AutoPager. It can also increment URLs and perform special actions, like clicking \"Load More\" buttons. You can save your settings for each URL and Infy will auto-activate the next time you visit them.\n\nI want you to be 100% happy with Infy\nIf something isn't working right, or if there's a feature you think is missing, please feel free to open an issue on GitHub and give me a chance to fix it and I promise I will. Thank you so much for using Infy.\n\nFeatures\n- 4 Actions: Next Link, Increment URL, Click Button, URL List\n- 4 Append Modes: Page (for Simple Websites), Iframe (for Complex Websites), Element (AutoPagerize Mode), and Media (for Images like 001.jpg)\n- Element Picker: Pick an element on the page and generate its CSS Selector or XPath expression automatically or use the EP's buttons to traverse the DOM in any direction (May not work on complex websites)\n- \"Auto Detect Page Element\" (a new innovative feature): Let Infy's algorithm try to detect the page element for you roughly ~50% of the time (May not work well on complex websites)\n- Next Link Algorithm: Let Infy's algorithm also try to figure out the next link for you by using your own customizable keywords\n- Auto Mode: Automatically append pages, or use Slideshow Mode with Pause and Repeat\n- Save URLs: Infy can save custom site-specific settings and then auto-activate on your favorite URLs\n- AutoPagerize Database: Infy can use the AP Database to pre-configure thousands of websites for you automatically\n- Custom Scripts: Infy has custom scripts for a few popular websites (such as Google Search) that will try to fix missing image thumbnails\n- Advanced Features: Fix lazy loading or use the Element Iframe mode to fix missing images while in AP mode\n- Uses 0 Background Memory when inactive\n- No Ads, No Tracking, No Bloat\n\nPermissions Justification\n\"Read and change all your data on the websites you visit\" - Infy needs to request this permission so that its content script can auto-activate on any Saved URL or Database URL you want it to.\n\"wedata.net\" and \"github.io\" - Infy needs to request permissions to these domains so it can download and use the AutoPagerize Database.\n\nPrivacy Policy\nInfy Scroll does *not* track you.

This is especially true if your paycheck doesn’t go as far as you would hope to be. \n\nWhen you were in college and if you don’t calculate your expenses well ahead of time, you will always run out of money before the month ends. If you want to simplify your life, you should consider using an online calculator.\n\nA few decades ago, people had unique ways to do their math. Items and objects like stones, leaves or sticks were used largely for computation purposes. This continued for a long time and soon enough, it became obsolete.\n\nThe high demand on dealing with numbers on a daily basis led to several inventions. The early version of calculators was limited in their functionalities, and for this reason, other forms of calculator gadgets came into the picture.\n\nNowadays, people rely on the Internet for many things and life is moving at a fast pace. With the economies and technologies growing at an exponential rate, the need for a better gadget that can meet the needed functionalities faster and quicker is paramount. This need has been felt wide and across to have a calculating gadget that could perform specific functions.\n\nThe emergence of different types of calculators simplified the lives of many. At present, there are many types of calculators available, both handheld and online applications. Some of these calculators can perform the basic tasks and some are highly specialized. In fact, other types of calculators are impressively programmable while some can only solve a simple arithmetic.\n\nDepends on what your need is, but getting the right calculator can be a daunting task to some people. Unless you do the hard work of researching for the perfect calculator that suits your needs, it will not help you speed up your calculation process."

In the future a remote storage for your data might be added.\n\n============ Attention previous users!!! ============\nDue to popular demand we decided to update YT Looper so it is compatible with the newest version of Youtube website. \nIf you like this extension please support it by giving it a review and sharing it with others.

So if you have two email tabs opened and still one tab is open, you are still logged-in. Once the other tab is closed, you will get logged-out\n\nNote: the extension does not support cleaning  \"window.localStorage\" at this moment. I will work on that later!\n\nTo report bugs please use the review section of the FAQs page\n"

    "description": "Control Panel for Twitter is a browser extension for Twitter - its main goals are to reduce the amount of algorithmic content you see, give you more control over your timeline and make the UI less distracting.\n\nBy default, your Home timeline will be the reverse-chronological \"Following\" timeline, which will only contain tweets and quote tweets from the people you follow. The algorithmic \"For you\" timeline will be hidden, and Control Panel for Twitter will keep you on \"Following\" if Twitter tries to automatically take you off it. Everything is configurable, so start by opening the options popup and customizing to your liking. Changes you make in the options will be applied immediately.\n\nFeatures:\n\nHome timeline\n\n• Defaults to the \"Following\" (chronological) timeline, automatically switching you back if Twitter tries to move you to the \"For you\" (algorithmic) timeline\n• Hide the \"For you\" timeline tab (default setting)\n• Move Retweets to a separate tab (default setting), or hide them entirely\n• Move Quote Tweets and replies to them to a separate tab in the Home timeline, or hide them entirely\n• Hide tweets quoting accounts you've blocked or muted\n• Mute quoting of specific tweets - adds a \"Mute this conversation\" menu item to Quote Tweets in the Home and List timelines\n• Hide \"Who to follow\", \"Follow some Topics\" etc. in the Home timeline and elsewhere\n• Full-width timeline: hide the sidebar and let timeline content go full-width on Home, Lists and Communities\n\nUI improvements\n\n• Hide Views under tweets\n• Hide the \"Verified\" tab on the Notifications page\n• Replace Twitter Blue checkmarks with the Blue logo so they're not as easily mistaken for verified accounts, or hide them altogether\n• Add \"Add muted word\" to the \"More\" menu\n• Fast blocking - skips the confirm dialog when you try to block an account\n• Toggle Retweets in Lists - adds a \"Turn off Retweets\" menu item to Lists\n• Use the site's normal text font style in the primary navigation menu to make it less distracting\n• Use normal font weight in dropdown menus - if everything's bold, nothing's bold\n\nUI tweaks\n\n• Disable use of the Chirp font if you don't like it\n• Uninvert the Follow and Following buttons to make them less jarring\n  • Choice of monochrome or themed (classic) styling for uninverted buttons\n• Default to \"Latest\" tab in Search\n• When viewing a tweet's Quote Tweets, hide the quoted tweet to make more room for quotes\n\nRemove algorithmic content\n\n• Hide \"What's happening\", \"Topics to follow\" etc. in the sidebar\n• Hide Explore page contents and use it only for searching\n• Hide \"Discover more\" algorithmic tweets when viewing a tweet\n\nReduce \"engagement\"\n\n• Hide metrics\n• Reduced interaction mode: hide the action bar under tweets – replies are now the only means of interacting\n• Disable the home timeline: find yourself wasting too much time on Twitter? Try preventing use of the home timeline, going to Notifications or Messages by default instead\n\nHide UI items you don't use\n\n• Share button under tweets\n• Analytics links under your own tweets\n• Hide navigation items you don't use, and other distracting screen elements such as the account switcher and Messages drawer\n• Hide items you don't use in the \"More\" menu\n\nTWITTER, TWEET and RETWEET are trademarks of Twitter Inc. or its affiliates"

All major browsers have the ability to gather your digital fingerprints during your browsing session, thus creating your personal tracking\nprofile – your digital fingerprint! \n\nThese unique profiles are then sold to advertising agencies,\nresulting in so-called “personalized” popups, commercials and other forms of ads.\nFurthermore, that information can also be abused if it reaches the wrong hands.\nIdentity Theft Preventer Fingerprint Blocker allows you to proactively deny such profiling and tracking attempts. Without affecting your browsing experience, the Fingerprint Blocker will block all tracking attempts made by either cookies, fingerprinting algorithms or other tracking methods – thus allowing you to browse the internet without any personal information leaked.\nBe it your browsing habits, shopping preferences, or social activity – that information is now all yours to keep for yourself.\n\nAd Blocker!\nSurf the web safely and conveniently without being annoyed by flashing banners and distracting ads.\nThe Ad Blocking feature will block both static and dynamic banners, making your browsing experience smoother and faster.\n\nKey Features:\n• Fingerprinting Log Detection and Protection\n• Hiding Personal Information\n• Deleting Personal Information\n• Masking Browsing Preferences\n• Blocking Third Party Trackers\n• Hiding Browser Data\n• Ad Blocker"

You can capture a portion of the page, the visual viewport, or even the entire page if it has both vertical and horizontal scroll bars. The captured image can be saved to the default download directory, placed in the clipboard, or opened in an online paint editor. This extension currently uses JSPaint, a web-based replica of MS Paint, which can work offline and allow you to edit your images even without an internet connection.\n\nThis extension adds a toolbar button to the browser's action area. Clicking on this button opens a popup window that contains three options:\n1.  \"Capture Entire Screen\"\n2. \"Capture Visual Part\"\n3. \"Capture a Portion\"\n\nThese items are also added to the right-click context menu of the page for easy access.\n\nNotes:\n1. If the page size is larger than your window size and the \"Capture Entire Screen\" option is selected, the extension will need to scroll the entire page to capture different parts and merge them into a single image. This process may take a few seconds to complete.\n2. The resolution of the taken image depends on the screen resolution. For example, if you have a 4K display (like Retina displays), the image resolution will be at least four times better than that of a normal display.\n3. To ensure compatibility with various devices, this extension stores all captured screenshots in the PNG format. This format is widely supported and offers high-quality images.\n4. This extension does NOT add watermarks to the captured image. It is a free and open-source project.\n5. To change the format of the filenames for downloaded images, go to the options page and use the filename mask option."

The orange button can be used to generate distraction-free PDF documents and the blue one generates a normal PDF document. It is also possible to press the toolbar button (action button) to convert multiple emails to PDF at once. For bulk conversion, you need to select a few threads first.\n\nNotes:\n1. The orange button is called the \"simple\" mode of operation. In this mode, your emails are reformated and all the images, lines, and any other distracting elements are removed from the document before the PDF file is generated. This is useful to generate PDF for fast reading.\n\n2. The blue button is called the \"normal\" mode of operation. In this mode, the \"window.print()\" function is called and the generated document is in the standard format.\n3. This extension does NOT send your documents to an external server for conversion as this violates the user's privacy. The extension uses a local JavaScript library called jsPDF for all its conversions.\n4. By default, no image is attached to your document if the \"simple\" mode is selected so that there would be no image fetching from remote servers.\n\nFor more info please visit:\nhttps://add0n.com/to-pdf.html?from=gmail\nTo report bugs please visit:\nhttps://github.com/ray-lothian/to-pdf/issues\n\nChange Log:\nversion 0.1.5\n1. You can now customize the filename\n2. There are options to hide both or either print and simple mode buttons\n3. The extension now embeds a few popular fonts to the PDF document so it will look better in the simple printing mode.\nversion 0.1.7\n1.

Save more!\nWhen you are editing a content that has lots of links, wouldn't it be handy to quickly check that all the links on the page are working? \n'Broken Link Checker' scans your page or the whole site and provides a broken links report within a few minutes. \nThe report is generated directly without installing and running any additional program files. \n\nThen 'Broken Link Checker' highlights which links are functioning and which ones are broken. \n\nIn addition to the website internal links check, we analyze the external links availability. \nIf the site contains at least one external link (nofollow or dofollow) with 404 error, it is shown in the report. \nThe report contains link to page where 404 error was found, so you can fix it immediately.\n\n'Broken Link Checker' is an extension developed primarily for web designers, developers and content editors.\n\n# ADDITIONAL FEATURES PROVIDED BY ATOMSEO SERVICE\n* Backlink watch.\n* Automatically monitor your links on a daily basis.\n\n# WHY TO CHECK YOUR BROKEN AND DEAD PAGES\nThere are several factors that can improve the \"visibility\" of your page and influence its ranking in Google and other search engines.\nAn important aspect of search engine optimization is work with content; the promotion success depends on content quality and quantity.\n\nMany blogs, articles and services offer guides and recommendations on content organization, keyword selection and compilation of semantic core. \nHowever, the topics of monitoring and tracking the content availability are mostly overlooked.\n\n# WHY BROKEN LINKS CAN DAMAGE YOUR ONLINE BUSINESS\n\n## CUSTOMER ASPECT\nA potential client visits the site to get some information and cannot find it because the page is not available.\nAt best, customer goes to other pages on the site, and at worst just leaves the site. \nYour bounce rate increases and the client is lost.\n\n## SEARCH ENGINE VISIBILITY\nIf a site contains too many pages with a response code \"404\", it can have a negative impact on your website's ranking in major search engines. \nThe entire site or individual pages may receive a Google penalty, site rankings can fall, and the number of visits will be reduced.\n\n## LOSING BACKLINKS\nThe number of incoming links to your website impacts search engine ranking. \nAny website owner knows how difficult it is to get quality links and references.\nAt the same time, not enough attention is given to monitoring the availability of external linked pages.\n\n## BROKEN LINKS = LOST OPPORTUNITIES\nCreating and managing website content is a complex process, which is always associated with many manual adjustments. \nMultiple site editors, frequent updates, the need for regular content updating - all these processes increase probability of various errors. \nThe most important errors associate with the creation and addition of non-existing pages or broken links.\n\nDespite the fact that the link verification is an obvious need, most webmasters and site owners do not give enough attention to this issue or just ignore it. \nThey lose opportunities to promote their own site because of this very trivial problem.\n\n## WHY BROKEN LINKS ARE BAD?\nFirst of all, they leave a bad feeling about your company or product and you can lose a potential customer. \nYou should respect customers and display only working content!\nAlso, broken links make your site indexing by search engines more complicated, and, therefore, \nreduce the possibility of the correct ranking of your website.\n\n# YOUR BROKEN LINKS ARE YOUR COMPETITORS’ BENEFITS\n\nYour broken links are opportunities for other webmasters to raise their website rating at your expense. \nThe link building due to non-existent pages (404 error) and dead links is very popular among webmasters. \nMany manuals and tools were created for broken links search and further replacement with their own links. \nThis is a simple and free link building in a legal way (white hat SEO). \nIf you do not care about your broken links, others do. \nPerhaps, while you read this text, other webmasters are already hunting for your dead links. \nDo not give them a chance!\n\nCOMMENTS AND FEEDBACK ARE WELCOME.\n\nhttps://error404.atomseo.com\ninfo@atomseo.com"

The extension uses this tab to obtain an updated access token. It is due to the features of the Microsoft identity platform. Details: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/issues/62164.\n\nKnown disadvantages\n* When you select a list, the lists are shown in an un-grouped form. Reason: the public API does not allow you to get information about grouping lists.\n* This is not an official extension. But unfortunately, there's no official extension at this time – https://todo.uservoice.com/forums/597175-feature-suggestions/suggestions/32661145-browser-extension-firefox-chrome-edge-opera-s\n* The extension requires the seemingly unnecessary \"Read browsing history\" permission. But this permission is needed for an alternative implementation of user authentication. The reason is the inability to use the stock chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow with the Microsoft identity platform. More details: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/issues/62164."

Open your\n3D model files quickly. You can also open OBJ files using this extension software\n\nSTL Files - STL (an abbreviation of \"stereolithography\") is a file format native to the stereolithography CAD software created by 3D Systems.\nSTL has several backronyms such as \"Standard Triangle Language\" and \"Standard Tessellation Language\". This file format is supported by many other software packages; it is widely used for rapid prototyping, \n3D printing and computer-aided manufacturing. STL files describe only the surface geometry of a three-dimensional object without any representation of color, texture or other common CAD model attributes. \nThe STL format specifies both ASCII and binary representations. Binary files are more common, since they are more compact.[\n\nAn STL file describes a raw, unstructured triangulated surface by the unit normal and vertices (ordered by the right-hand rule) of the triangles using a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. \nIn the original specification, all STL coordinates were required to be positive numbers, but this restriction is no longer enforced and negative coordinates are commonly encountered in STL files today. \nSTL files contain no scale information, and the units are arbitrary.\n\nOBJ Files - OBJ (or .OBJ) is a geometry definition file format first developed by Wavefront Technologies for its Advanced Visualizer animation package. The file format is open and has been adopted \nby other 3D graphics application vendors.\n\nThe OBJ file format is a simple data-format that represents 3D geometry alone — namely, the position of each vertex, the UV position of each texture coordinate vertex, vertex normals, and the faces \nthat make each polygon defined as a list of vertices, and texture vertices. Vertices are stored in a counter-clockwise order by default, making explicit declaration of face normals unnecessary. OBJ coordinates\n have no units, but OBJ files can contain scale information in a human readable comment line."

If you wish to focus, you may buy shares in only one gold company. However, if you wish to diversify and buy a basket of companies in the gold industry, it is easier to invest in a Gold ETF (Exchange Traded Fund)\n\nWhat is gold used for?\nThere are many industrial purpose uses for gold. It is used for the CPUs inside your computer. The main reason gold is used inside electronics is its high resistance to corrosion, and it conducts electricity very well. The main use of gold nowadays is for jewellry and accessories in the consumer market.

Most file formats only show the lines that were changed and several surrounding lines, so it's usually not a terrible inconvenience, but for any markdown document (.md) the situation is different. GitHub shows the entire markdown document when previewing the changes made, which means that if you're making a few tiny edits to a large document, it's very hard to find those edits and see what's changed. Rmarkdown (.Rmd) documents behave similarly, and potentially other markdown-type documents as well.\n\nEnter: GitHub Diff Navigator.\n\n\nMotivation\n=========\n\nThe idea for this extension came when I was reading through Hadley Wickham's Advanced R book. Every time I found a few typos in a chapter (which is a single markdown document), I would edit it on GitHub and make a pull request.  \nTo make sure I didn't make an idiot out of myself, I wanted to double-check my edits in the Preview tab, but I noticed the problem described above. I didn't trust my eyes in finding the few edits in such large files, and I ended up using the DOM + JavaScript console to help me find where the edits were.  \nThen I decided that playing in the JavaScript console wasn't hardcore enough and I decided to spend the next two days making an extension that will help me find such changes quickly in the future.  \n\n\nFeatures\n=========\n\n- GitHub Diff Navigator is non-intrusive and will only show up when looking at the Preview of edits made on a file using GitHub.  \n- GitHub Diff Navigator will not take up any resources and not be active when you don't have a valid GitHub edited page open.  \n- Works with multiple GitHub tabs that are open simultaneously (every time you switch tabs, the extension will update to show you the edits in that tab).  \n- Automatically detect whether the file being edited is markdown-type or not, and seamlessly works for both.  \n- Clean and intuitive UI with helpful messages shown when no edits are found.  \n\n\nDisclaimer\n=========\n\nI would not advise using my code as a template or resource for learning how to write Edge extensions. I learned how to write the extension and fully built it within two days, so I'm not sure what the best practices are and how to properly organize the code. It was just an excuse to test out how extensions work. I also left a little bit of ugly code in there -- please don't judge :)"

It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.\n\nJSON is built on two structures:\n● A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.\n● An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.\n\nThese are universal data structures. Virtually all modern programming languages support them in one form or another. It makes sense that a data format that is interchangeable with programming languages also be based on these structures."

    "description": "Universal AI-powered task and UI test automation. RPA combines Visual Web Automation, Visual Desktop Automation and Selenium IDE++.\nThe combination of classical browser automation with modern computer vision makes UI.Vision RPA (formerly Kantu) the powerful and popular solution to automate web and desktop apps. UI.Vision RPA combines three robotic process automation (RPA) tools into one: \n\n(1) Visual Browser Automation and UI Testing\n\nThe visual UI testing commands of UI Vision help web designers and developers to verify and validate the layout of websites and canvas elements. UI Vision can read and recognize images and text inside canvas elements, images and videos. \n\nUI Vision can resize the browser's window in order to emulate various resolutions. This is particularly useful to test layouts on different browser resolutions, and to validate visually perfect mobile, web, and native apps.\n\n\n(2) Visual Desktop Automation for Windows, Mac and Linux\n\nUI Vision can not only see and automate everything inside the web browser. It uses image and text recognition to automate your desktop as well (Robotic Process Automation, RPA). UI Vision can read images and text on your desktop and click, move, drag & drop the mouse and simulate keyboard input.\n\nThe desktop automation feature requires the installation of the free UI Vision XModules. This is a separate software package available for Windows, Mac and Linux. It adds the “eyes” and “hands” to UI Vision.\n\n\n(3) Selenium IDE++\n\nUI Vision includes Selenium commands for general web automation, web testing, form filling & web scraping. But Kantu has a different design philosophy then the classic Selenium IDE. On the one hand it is a record & replay tool for automated testing just like the classic Selenium IDE, but even more it is a \"swiss army knife\" for general web automation like screen scraping, automating file uploads and autofill form filling. It has many features that the classic IDE does not (want to) have. For example, you can run your macros directly from the browser as bookmarks or even embed them on your website. If there’s an activity you have to do repeatedly, just create a web macro for it. The next time you need to do it, the entire macro will run at the click of a button and do the work for you.\n\nUI Vision RPA is intended as an Open-Source alternative to iMacros, UIPath and Selenium IDE, and supports all important Selenium IDE commands. When you invest the time to learn UI Vision RPA, you learn Selenium IDE at the same time. \n\nUI Vision includes many features that are not found in the classic Selenium IDE, such as the ability to write and read CSV files (data-driven testing), visual checks for UI testing, file download automation, PDF testing and the ability to take full web page and desktop screenshots.\n\n\n(API) Integrate with your favorite tools via command line\n\nUI Vision has a detailed command line API. This allows you to integrate UI Vision with any other application. For example, UI Vision is often integrated with Jenkins and CI/CD tools or the Windows task scheduler. UI Vision can be automated and controlled from any programming or scripting language, for example Python or Powershell. \n\nUI Vision web macros can be combined/used with other extensions such as Tampermonkey, Adblock, uBlock, NoScript, Ghostery, Video DownloadHelper, DownThemAll or LastPass.\n\nHappy Automating!\n\nFor questions and suggestions, please visit the active UI Vision RPA community forum at https://forum.ui.vision"

Also, you could return to the survey website after months and update your answers. Only if you consent, your survey responses will be used in our research. Please note that even if you consent, we will never collect your personal data.

If it's yellow, it indicates that the recommended GDPR setting has been made on this website. If red, it means that the website is not in our database, or the website does not offer a customized GDPR option.\n- We provide two slider options to support four functions:\n1.Enable Auto protection on currently visited website: After “Apply”, the extension will automatically set GDPR protection for the website you are currently visiting.\n2.Enable Auto protection on all visited websites: After clicking “Apply”, the extension will automatically set GDPR protections for all websites in our database.\n3.Enable Manual protection on currently visited website: Clicking “Apply” will reset GDPR cookies for the website you are currently visiting so that you could manually set GDPR options.\n4.Enable Manual protection on all visited websites: After “Apply”, we could reset GDPR cookies for all websites that you have set in your browser.\n\nIn \"Show all Cookies\" Panel:\n- We are using machine learning models to classify cookies into four categories: Strictly Necessary, Functionality, Performance and Targeting/Advertising Cookies.

For example you can keep your computer running for a while, then let it go to sleep. It also supports keyboard shortcuts to change the state.\n\nClick the extension icon, you can switch between three states:\n● Keep screen on: The computer does not go to sleep, and the screen keeps on. For example, when you do a presentation.\n● Keep system running: The computer does not go to sleep, but the screen can be turned off. For example, when you upload or download files, the screen can be turned off, but need to keep the system running.\n● System default state: Cancel the above two states. Whether to go to sleep or turn off the screen depends on the energy-saving setting of your operating system.\n\nThis extension provides a countdown timer. You can use it:\n1. Switch to default state. For example, when a program is being executed, it may take some time to complete. In this situation, you can set the state to keep system running, and switch to default state an hour later.\n2. Set a timer to close the tab that is playing a podcast or video when you go to bed. This may help you fall asleep better.\n\nNote: if you turn your computer to sleep manually (e.g. close the laptop lid), or quit the browser completely, this extension can't keep your computer running."

It acts as a personal automated security advisor that triggers vigilance at the moment it matters. Now, this anti-phishing software functionality is available to everyone because no amount of security awareness training, banking or government campaign will keep people alert to phishing attacks throughout a busy day.\n\nBlue Arca anti-phishing software acts as a safety barrier by alerting you to potential threats as they come in. It continuously checks all incoming email against a personal user profile. Any unknown sender or embedded link will trigger a notification for the user to check the potential security risk. When you mark it as a potential threat or as safe, you automatically report it to us for further investigation. Completely private. The anti-phishing extension works with Gmail, Outlook.com and Live.com."

If you’re already using a Web Monetization payment provider, Akita gives you insight into your contributions to the website by showing you the time spent on the site and the amount of payment streamed as a result.\n\nAs Web Monetization becomes more common on websites, you’ll be able to see the evolution through Akita. We hope to see your favourite sites join the Web Monetization community! All of the data collected about your browsing and streamed payments is stored in local browser storage, so all of this information stays in your hands.\n\nOverall, our goal with Akita is to increase Web Monetization exposure and awareness, and to help people understand how Web Monetization fits in with their regular browsing. We want to give people who aren’t using a Web Monetization provider a way to engage in payment streaming. As more Web Monetization providers pop up, users can choose providers that fit their needs based on the browsing data presented by Akita."

This extension provides Ubuntu GNOME, Kubuntu, Lubuntu and Xubuntu that can be run in the \"OnWorks\" free servers hosting provider\n\n1. This Ubuntu online is one of the most well known Linux versions, and comes equipped with the GNOME desktop. Although the previous Unity desktop was evaluated we have opted for GNOME. It has a classic desktop style with icons, a panel on the left mimicking its traditional dock, and a customized window looks. This Ubuntu online comes preinstalled with the most common System tools, Office utilities, Graphic programs and so on.\n\n2. This Kubuntu online inherits all the core features of Ubuntu but it looks different, due to the KDE Plasma, a desktop environment that a lot of users prefer. This KDE desktop provides access to programs and files clicking a left-bottom K-button (Kickoff Application Launcher), which is similar to the typical Start button. As with Ubuntu GNOME online, it has preinstalled applications like LibreOffice, Okular Document Viewer, Kontact, Rekonq, Amarok, and Dragon player. It must be also noted that Kubuntu offers a user interface easier to use for people that comes from Windows and Mac OS.\n\n3. This Xubuntu online also provides a lot of Ubuntu features but without compromising the performance and aesthetics. For that reason Xubuntu provides a desktop with a lot of bells and whistles while still striving not to impact too much on your PC system’s resources.\nThis Xubuntu online comes with the XFCE desktop, which is lighter when compared to GNOME, Unity or KDE. \n\n4. This Lubuntu online provides the lighter desktop based on the LxQt(LxDE) desktop environment.  LxQt(LXDE) is a desktop environment to be run on low spec systems. The desktop is simple and allows for you to place icons. It also supports a right-click menu. There are no desktop effects or animations.  Moreover, Lubuntu achieves leanness with applications and software that come packed with this particular distro. Instead of LibreOffice or something similar, end users are provided with Gnumeric and Abiword.\n\nNote that all of these Ubuntu online versions are integrated with the file manager that are provided by the OnWorks free hosting provider. This file manager can be used to save and load the files handled inside the OnWorks online workstations.\n"

If you'd like to support the continued development of the extension, please check out https://armin.dev/go/patreon\n\nThe extension helps journalists and researchers verify the authenticity of images, and assists in the identification of false information on social media. Search by Image is also popular among photographers, helping artists explore how their work is shared on the web, while shoppers find it valuable for discovering similar products at discounted prices.\n\nThe extension enables you to search for images from the context menu and the browser toolbar with the help of a diverse set of reverse image search engines, which can be toggled and reordered from the extension's options. Visit the wiki for the full list of supported search engines.\n\nhttps://github.com/dessant/search-by-image/wiki/Search-engines\n\nImages positioned at the selected area are detected regardless of how they were embedded in the page. The extension also supports searching with images from your device, images from private sites, and captured areas of the page.\n\nA handful of search modes are offered that serve different use cases. The search mode can be set independently for the context menu and the browser toolbar from the extension's options.\n\nSearch modes:\n  • Select URL: select an image on the page and search with the image URL. This is the default search mode.\n  • Select image: select an image on the page and search with the image file. This search mode is preferred for sites which do not allow the direct linking of images, such as private sites.\n  • Capture: search with a captured area of the page.\n  • Browse: search with an image from your device. Pasting images from the clipboard is also supported.\n  • URL: search with an image URL.\n\nThe \"Allow access to file URLs\" option must be enabled for the extension to search with local images opened in a tab. Visit the edge://extensions page and open the extension's details to find the option.\n\nThe image you select during a search is sent to the requested service, such as Google Images. Visit the extension's privacy policy for more information.\n\nThe extension is also available for Chrome and Safari: https://github.com/dessant/search-by-image#readme\n\nReviews are not monitored for bug reports, please use GitHub for issues and feature requests.\n\nhttps://github.com/dessant/search-by-image"

    "description": "Optimize your browser for productivity and focus with tabby! \n\nTabby removes your unnecessary tabs automatically, without distraction - and it gives you the peace of mind of being able to restore tabs with just one-click. \n\nIt’s all free.\n\nTabby.us is one of the most-advanced edge extension to deal with your tabs. \n\n✪ 4 MAIN BENEFITS ✪\n\n➤ 1) simplicity: tabby.us offers you an immersive experience online. The tool is a 1-click install button, and it offers you minimalistic settings from end to end. We believe our tool should work for you - and the other way round. Say goodbye to long hours of setup and customization.\n\n➤ 2) automation: tabby.us is designed to automate all the useless actions you do everyday on their browser. Examples are removing tabs, grouping tabs, reorganizing tabs, finding important tabs. With hundreds of useless clicks every day, professional have a serious ergonomics issue. We offer a new approach that will directly improve your focus.\n\n➤ 3) privacy and speed: tabby.us does not collect personal data. Tabby’s code is optimized for your browser speed. Enjoy longer hours of battery on your computer and more RAM in order to do more stuff online. (more on this below).\n\n➤ 4) impact on ecology: By enhancing the performance of your device, tabby enables you to save energy by avoiding to use a lot of RAM and CPU computation. Thus limiting the energy consumption of your device with ecological impact. It is better for you, better for your computer or laptop, better for the planet and environment.\n\n✪ THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE ✪\n\nWe believe tabs pollute our browser view, which causes several problems. \n➤ It is exhausting to work online because of thousands useless clicks your make. \n➤ It is tedious and repetitive to make the same actions on tabs all day long. It is inefficient for the computer speed. \n➤ It makes us inefficient and it slows down the computer: our mind is clouded, our days are stressful and our decision-making process is much slower. \n➤ It leads to greater energy consumption and thus consequences for the environment and the planet globally. Environmental activists have highlighted this problem and fight for the ecological values against the high usage of tabs/mails...\n\n\n✪ WHY TABBY.US IS DIFFERENT SOLUTION AND WHY YOU SHOULD TRUST US ✪\n\n➤ First, it is our core team philosophy. \n\nThe internet has become a very fragmented place for which the myriad of tabs are just an example. This has widespread scattered focus every day causing stress and discomfort.\n\nTo fight this, we built a product that improves Serenity at Work, all day long. You can now enjoy an integrated experience on your browser.\n\n➤ Second, it is our vision for the product.\n\nThe internet is full of customizable tools. They are so customizable or modular, that we spend hours configuring them up.\nTo fight this, we incorporated artificial intelligence to offer you a personalized and seamless experience.\n\nInstead of offering you a toolbox, we design a lean and stress-free experience.\n\nWe believe that irrelevant tabs should be temporarily removed from your user view to help you focus and spend more time on the important tabs. Not only does this increase your focus but it is saves you valuable time.\n\nOf course, you can restore any tab with just one-click, when the tab is ACTUALLY relevant for you.\n\nTo us, this process is a true  “decluttering of browser view”. Tabby.us is autonomous and smart to make its own decisions, but you can always correct its actions with only one click.\n\n➤ Third, we believe in the Community.\n\nOur mindful community of users also contribute to the environmental cause by reducing the use of energy worldwide. As a group, we orient our browser use towards a more ecological mindset.\n\nIf this philosophy resonates with you, please try tabby and send us an email with your feedback.\n\n➤ Learn more here: https://www.tabby.us/\n➤ Join our community: https://bit.ly/31N9g2f"

LanguageTool detects many errors that a simple spell checker cannot, such as grammar issues, commonly confused words, and punctuation oversights. Additionally, LanguageTool offers style suggestions to elevate your writing: synonym replacements for overused words, concise rephrasing of wordy sentences, and formal alternatives to commonly used expressions.\n\nLanguageTool is designed with simplicity in mind, instantly analyzing your text as you type. It is compatible with most platforms, including social networks such as Twitter and LinkedIn, and e-mail services such as Gmail.\n\nWith LanguageTool, our aim is to give users a full-feature grammar checker and proofreader that will enable them to have control and confidence over their content. While LanguageTool is a vital extension for non-native speakers, it also recognizes many mistakes that are frequently made by native speakers. This grammar and spelling correction works across several varieties of commonly spoken languages, and is capable of distinguishing between American and British English. LanguageTool also features a personal dictionary for exceptions or words that you might commonly use, but are not found in a conventional dictionary; it will learn to recognize these words for future grammar checking and proofreading.\n\nUnlike other services like Grammarly (a.k.a.

The advantage of this is that you can also use the paper icon in the upper rightcorner to copy all the keywords to your clipboard.\n\n*** Product rating ***\n\nWith the rating widget you can find out with how many stars the products on the SERP were rated. We get this data for the organic ranking products as well as for the sponsored products.\n\n*** Reviews *** \n\nIn the review’s widget, you will see the number of reviews that the products on the SERP have received on average. As usual, a distinction is made here between organically ranking products and sponsored products.\n\n*** Price *** \n\nThe price widget shows you in which price ranges the products on the SERP are being sold. Here again, we distinguish between organically ranking products and sponsored products.\n\n*** Prime *** \n\nFinally, the Prime widget shows you the percentage of products available as Prime as well as “not” Prime on the SERP."

Also, it adjusts video qualities that are streamed to the members to optimize bandwidth. Meeting does not have a limit on the number of attendees as fas as the network can handle streams to all peers. You can even have your own signaling server if you want to increase the privacy or use Meeting on a protected or a local network."

You can activate the extension by pressing the action button. Also, use the right-click context menu over the action button to modify which headers the extension manipulates. You can also ask the extension not to overwrite these headers when the server returns values for them.\n\nThe default values for the headers:\n\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: request initiator or empty\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods\": GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, MKCOL, COPY, MOVE, LOCK\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: request initiator or empty \nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\nAccess-Control-Expose-Headers: request initiator or *\n\nAdditional Features:\n1. It can remove the following CSP-related headers: \n\"Content-Security-Policy\", \"Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only\", \"X-WebKit-CSP\" and \"X-Content-Security-Policy\".\n\n2. It can overwrite the returned 4xx status code from the server. Use this feature when a server does not support a method, but you want to pretend it does. \n\n3. It can append necessary headers to pretend websites (local or remote hosts) support SharedArrayBuffer class. \n\n4. It can permit cross-origin frame embedding (by removing the \"X-Frame-Options\" header) to simplify remote page embedding during local development.\n\n5. It can include or exclude the \"referer\" and \"origin\" headers when a server is sensitive to them to work appropriately.\n\n6. The extension optionally uses the \"chrome.debugger\" to overwrite 4xx status codes (in case a server does not support a method, you can use this feature to pretend the server accepts a response or supports an unsupported method).\n\n7. The extension also optionally fixes CORS policies of redirected URLs.\n\n--\nIt is important to note that this extension fixes preflight requests to permit access to any custom header (when enabled). \n\nLinks:\n1.

Also, it supports audio recording. The user can either ask the extension to record the system sound (whatever is playing in the background) or use the user's microphone device for recording. The output format of the media files is the WebM format, which is the best choice for media sharing due to its compression level and real-time rendering.\n\nFeatures:\n1. It is possible to use this extension to record long screen captures since it directly writes chunks to the disk while recording.\n2. Recover recordings in case of a browser crash.\n3. Use a built-in tool to draw or write during the presentation\n4. Record audio from speaker, microphone, or both\n5. Adjust video quality (HD, Medium, Low, or Default)\n6.

If the extension icon turns blue, that means it found a Facebook page. Just click the \"Ads\" extension icon and it will open the brand's ads in Facebook Ads Library. If the icon stays grey, that means no page was found. You can still click the icon to open up Facebook Ads Library and search for the brand manually.\n\nThe extension also works on Facebook business pages in addition to websites. You can go directly to any Facebook page and click the extension to see the associated ads.\n\nThe goal of the extension is to make it simple for marketers to see competitors' Facebook ads, client ads or their own ads quickly and easily.\n\nWe hope this extension is useful for marketers or anyone looking to learn more about Facebook Ads. We welcome any feedback and intend to improve the extension and add functionality over time. "

HTTP enables visitors to view a website and send information back and forth to the server. HTTPS, or Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol Secure, is communication through a secure connection.

Save yourself from having to click on the language switcher every time.\n\nBy default Apple's docs open up for the Swift programming language. The website used to remember if you've changed the language to Objective-C from the language picker. However, this feature seems to be broken or removed. This extension aims to provide a solution to this problem. When you click on the extension button or you visit the options of the extension you can choose which language to be the default one or outright disable the functionality.\nSince this extension is aimed at Objective-C developers the default settings of the extension are Objective-C for language and enabled to get started as quickly as possible.\nThis extension can also help in case you're frequently visiting links that are for the Objective-C language. Just change the default language to Swift and it will detect and block Objective-C links as soon as you click on them resulting in a redirect to the Swift docs.\nBecause of the way the Apple developer docs were built and the simplicity of this extension it only works when directly visiting developer.apple.com such as from a web search or typing in the URL. developer.apple.com is a single page application meaning that when you're on the website the whole site doesn't reload when you click on a link. That means that if you choose a different language from the language picker it will keep using this language until you exit the website or refresh the page. This extension doesn't detect if you changed the language from the website which means that when you click to open a link in a new tab it will revert back to the default language from the extension settings.\nDocumentation that is only available in Swift will still be available.\n\nThis extension is open source. Click on the website link on the right to view the source code. Any contributions are welcome!\n\nThis extension works only on https://developer.apple.com/documentation/"

(You know: the ones that rhyme with 'Blue Cube', 'Space Hook', 'Sticky Media', 'Quitter', and the like.) All you need to do is specify which sites to block and when to block them.\n\nYou can specify up to 30 sets of sites to block, with different times and days for each set. You can block sites within fixed time periods (e.g., between 9am and 5pm), after a time limit (e.g., allow up to 10 minutes in every hour), or with a combination of time periods and time limit (e.g., allow up to 10 minutes in every hour between 9am and 5pm).\n\nAdditional features:\n\n• Lockdown: Block sites immediately for a specified duration.\n• Access control: Set a password or random access code for the options page, to slow you down in moments of weakness!\n• Delaying: Set a countdown to delay access to sites instead of completely blocking them.\n• Wildcards: Block a range of sites (e.g., *.somesite.com).\n• Exceptions: Whitelist sites you don't want to be blocked (e.g., +allowedsite.com).\n\nVersion history: https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/version-history/\n\nUsage examples: https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/examples/\n\nPermissions explained: https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/faq/permissions/\n\nFrequently asked questions: https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/faq/\n\nCommunity support: https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/leechblock/"

    "description": "\"Media Player\" is a browser extension to play music and video files either locally or from an online source. This project aims to bring VLC like media playing experience by using native HTML5 technology. The add-on is built on top of the well-known video.js project by applying a few custom plug-ins to enhance the user experience. This player supports media boosting, speed control, playlist media selection, fullwidth-progress bar, HTTP-streaming (M3U8), and wave surfer visual for audio files.\n\nYou can start watching an offline video file by drag and drop the video file into the player or by pressing the big play button. To have the player load subtitle as well, make sure to drop both video and subtitle files together (The dropped subtitle should have the same name as the file and needs to be in SRT or VTT format). Also, you can add a subtitle file later using the \"+CC\" button. This button appears when there is no subtitle found for the current track.\n\nYou can use your keyboard to control the following playback options:\n1. \"F\" key: This will toggle the fullscreen mode on and off\n2. \"Space\" key: This will toggle the playing state of the player\n3. \"Key Up\" and \"key Down\": These keys can be used to increase or decrease volume.\n4. \"Key Left\" and \"Key Right\": These keys can be used to seek backward and forward for 10 seconds.\n\nThis extension also supports media keys even if the player is not focused. Additionally, the mouse wheel can also be used to increase or decrease the volume.\n\nChange Log:\n0.1.2:\n1. Media Player now supports history (it will save the current track position and retrieves it after a restart)\n2. Media player now supports global keyboard shortcuts for toggle pause and play state, move to the previous track and move to the next track\n0.1.3:\n1. Better playlist!\n0.1.4:\n1. For audio tracks, a seek-able wave-surfer is replaced the old poster image\n2. playback rate is now adjustable.\n0.1.7:\n1. Supports live stream (m3u8)\n2.

My Desires lets you create a uniquely customizable and totally free baby registry where you can add any gift you would like from anywhere. From the nursery that caught your eye at Pottery Barn Kids, to the Sophie Giraffe teether you saw at Amazon, but also for example the paper crafted mobile you saw in a small shop in your neighborhoud and that you snapped a picture of with your mobile. Distribute your baby registry among your friends and family and they will be able to indicate the gift they would like to offer. They are free to buy the gift at the store you will have indicated on your registry and have it delivered at your address, or to make a financial contribution directly on your bank account, or to buy it in another store they would prefer and give it to you personally when you meet. No more unwanted or double gifts !\n\nEASY TO USE & ADAPTS TO ALL SCREENS\nWe took great care to create a very easy to use interface targeted to everybody, from the 8 year old niece to the 88 year old grandmother. Booking a gift only takes two clicks and does not require an account with us. Creating a baby registry or adding gifts to it is just as quick and easy thanks to our assistant. Furthermore, your baby registry is directly accessible and adapts to all connected devices and screensizes, from your desktop or laptop to your tablet and your mobile phone. You can browse your baby registry in a store with your mobile phone, take a picture of a gift you just saw and add it directly to your registry on the fly.\n\nIN ONE SENTENCE\nCreate and customize your baby registry for free and have total freedom in your choice of gifts and stores !"

    "description": "Co:Writer® Universal Extension for Microsoft Edge helps you write with proper grammar and spelling using topic-specific vocabulary. It integrates with the Edge browser for word prediction just about anywhere you write online including Microsoft Word, Google Drive™, blogs, Learning Management Systems, testing, social networks, and email.\n\nTry it for free and see if it works for you. Pricing and more information can be viewed at https://cowriter.com \n\nHow Does Co:Writer Work?\nAs letters are typed, Co:Writer predicts the intended word with a selection of word suggestions using powerful grammar-smart word prediction. These suggestions can be read aloud by moving the cursor over the words. Selecting the intended word places it into the built-in writing document. For feedback while writing (and after writing) built-in text to speech can be used to read letters, words, sentences, and any selected text. \n\n4+ Million Topic-Specific Dictionaries:\nCo:Writer has access to a main prediction dictionary (that includes core words) and Topic Dictionaries (that includes topic specific words).  Co:Writer can access over 4 million topic-specific dictionaries which are activated based on the writing task.\n\nA small sampling of the variety of topic dictionaries:\n  ✔ America's Cup\n  ✔ Compare and Contrast\n  ✔ Dinosaurs\n  ✔ Grumpy Cat\n  ✔ History of the Peloponnesian War\n  ✔ Mahatma Gandhi\n  ✔ My Dog\n  ✔ Pig Latin\n  ✔ SpongeBob SquarePants\n  ✔ Tommy (album)\n  ✔ Wonders of the World\n\nSpelling Support:\nCo:Writer uses Flexspell™ technology to handle the widest range of spelling mistakes including phonetic spelling and inventive spelling errors (letter omissions, word ending omissions, letter reversals, etc).\n\nExamples of how Co:Writer aides with phonetic and/or inventive spelling:\n\nBefore Co:Writer:\nThe blk jargon flu over the bra lfnt. \nR u hpy to ce me? \nI no hw to nor the fone. \n\nAfter Co:Writer:\nThe black dragon flew over the gray elephant.\nAre you happy to see me?\nI know how to answer the phone.\n\nGrammar Support:\nCo:Writer bases its prediction on proper grammar, and uses its understanding of grammar to accurately predict words within the framework of valid sentence structures.  \nExamples of how Co:Writer aides with grammar:\nDogs are furry. (noun, verb, adj.) - When you typed d-o, you get plural noun choices\nThree very mangy dogs ran down the street. (adj., adv., adj., noun, verb… etc.) - After typing three, very, mangy, you get plural noun choices, then you get plural verb tenses."

    "description": "A multi-feature add-on to fix some annoyances, make Flickr more \"explorative\" and bring back some lost features...\n\nThe current major features:\n\n1) Album-teaser column on photostreams.\nIn one of the big Flickr-updates some years ago, the column to feature a photographer’s albums or collections disappeared and made Flickr less gallery-like and less inviting for exploration in photographers' “backlog”. But Flickr Fixr puts back a column featuring albums on every photographer's photostreams. The 10 first albums as sorted in Flickr Organizer are shown in this column.\n\n2) Direct tag-links to same photographer's photos.\nWhen hovering the mouse over a photo-tag, Flick Fixr adds an extra link in tag, pointing to the same photographer's similar tagged photos.\n\n3) Links to album-map and album-comments.\nAdds two extra links in \"album headers\". One link pointing to a map with current album's photos, and another link pointing to the old hidden/forgotten page with album comments. The last is also a great page for reading (and editing) long album descriptions.\n\n4) Highlight geotagged photo on associated map + Google Maps link.\nMakes sure geoposition of photo is highlighted when following link to Flickr Map from a geotagged photo. Plus, on the photopage for a geotagged photo, also adds a link to show geoposition of photo directly on Google Maps.\n\n5) Top-pagination for fast an easy navigation.\nAre you annoyed by having to scroll to the bottom of photostreams for pagination? Flickr Fixr adds a pagination-bar above the streams for fast and easy navigation. But because the pager-bar sometimes gets pretty wide and might overlap other icons or dropdowns also placed right above the photostream, the top-pager is hidden until you hover your mouse over the center-area right above the photostream. The top-pager is available on photostreams, album-pages, favorite collections, (\"beta experience\") group pools and on the Explore page.\n\n6) Explore Calendar and Recent Uploads.\nOn the Explore page, Flickr Fixr adds a link to the hidden/forgotten Explore Calendar and to a page showing some of the latest uploads to Flickr. A little warning regarding the latest uploads though; Even though Safe Search is activated on that page, you risk seeing stuff you might have preferred not to see.\n\n7) Extra top menu items.\nAdds Tags, Collections and Map items to both the user (\"You\" dropdown) and the photographer menus (menu bar).\n\n8) Extended date & time information on photopages.\nVia mouseover, show both Taken and Upload dates in detail when available. Taken date will also work as a link to more photos from the same photographer.\n\n9) Show available newsfeeds.\nWhen an Atom or RSS newsfeed is detected on a Flickr page, an orange feed-icon is added as link to this. The feed-icons are added in upper right corner of the pages. Feature works both for pages on the main flickr.com domain and for the blogs on blog.flickr.net and code.flickr.net.\n\n10) Set speed of slideshows\nVia Flickr Fixr's Options page you can set the number of seconds each image are to be shown when running a slideshow on Flickr. Flickr's (normally fixed) duration is 5 seconds pr. image, but Flickr Fixr allow you to set the duration to any number between 1 and 60 seconds pr. image.\n\nFlickr Fixr has an Options page where you can enable or disable features you like or dislike.\n\nMore info about Flickr Fixr in the \"Flickr Hacks\" forum on Flickr. This includes additional details on restrictions and behavior of the photo upscale/replace feature. You will also find announcements of new versions and features here, plus bug reports and other feedback:\nhttps://www.flickr.com/groups/flickrhacks/discuss/72157655601688753/\n\nHave an awesome time on Flickr :-)\n\n/Stig\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/stignygaard/\nhttps://www.rockland.dk/\n"

Try this extension: https://bit.ly/empty-new-tab-page-edge\n\nVideo Guide: https://bit.ly/3kBjF9l\n\n★ Theme background\nWhen Clear New Tab is installed and the \"Theme Background\" mode is chosen, backgrounds of themes that you install in the Edge Add-ons store will be automatically downloaded and appear in the new tab. If a theme background is too big or too small you can fix it (set \"Background size\" to \"Cover the screen\"). \n\n★ Your own background\nYou can upload your own background (image, gif, video or solid color) as a background in the new tab page.\n\n★ Cycle through different backgrounds\nYou can make Clear New Tab cycle through your backgrounds, showing you different background every time you open a new tab.\n\n★ Random solid color\nClear New Tab can show you a randomly generated solid color background every time you open a new tab.\n\n★ Schedule a background\nIn the \"Scheduled\" mode, the new tab will display a specific background(s) at the date and time you choose.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nFAQ\n\nThere's no search bar. How to search the web?\nYou can search with the address bar.\n\nThere's no bookmarks bar in the new tab. Why does Clear New Tab hide it?\nClear New Tab doesn't hide it. If an extension replaces the default new tab page, Edge will automatically hide the bookmarks bar in the new tab. There is no way to force it back unless you set the bookmarks bar to be always visible by hitting Ctrl + Shift + B.\n\nHow to eliminate \"white flash\" before a background is displayed when you open a new tab?\nYou can replace white to another color with the \"Color of area around background\" input. Make sure that \"Settings context\" is set to \"Global\".\n\nTheme’s background doesn’t fit the screen, can I fix it?\nSelect \"Cover the screen\" or \"Fit to the browser window\" option in the \"Background size\" select.\n\nLinks added as custom HTML are not working. How to fix them?\nAdd target=\"_top\" to the <a> tag.\nExample:\n<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com\" target=\"_top\">Link</a>\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nKnown issues\n\nWhen a theme is being installed options page opens.\nThis is the issue related to manifest 3.\n\nThe slideshow stops after some time.\nThis is the issue related to manifest 3. Set \"Change background every\" to \"1 minute\" or higher to fix this.\n\nClear New Tab data can be automatically removed by a browser.\nClear New Tab uses IndexedDB to store user data. The browser can remove IndexedDB data if it thinks the user doesn't have enough free space.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nPermissions:\n\nRead and modify your data on a number of websites \nAllows the extension to download a theme crx package that contains a theme background and other data about a theme (background repeat, сolor of area around background etc).\n\nChange the page you see when you open a new tab\nAllows the extension to show a background image in the new tab.\n\nManage your apps, extensions, and themes\nAllows the extension to detect when a theme is installed and gives it information about a theme (theme id, theme name etc). Theme id is used to download crx.\n\nOptional permissions:\nRead data you copy and paste\nAllows the extension to paste an image or a link to an image in the \"Paste image or URL\" input with the \"Paste\" button.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nGitHub: https://bit.ly/clear-new-tab-github\n\nFollow my Facebook page (more extensions): https://bit.ly/browservery"

    "description": "\"Dark Theme for YouTube\" extension converts YouTube theme to a highly customizable dark charcoal/blue theme. This extension is built on top of the default YouTube theme (native dark theme) so it is very light-weighted compare to using themes injected by Stylish or Stylus extensions.\n\nFeatures:\nTurn on and off from the action button to switch between light and dark themes\nAccepts scheduling to turn on only on the specified period\nCustomize default color scheme\nInject custom CSS to alter the default theme (change font-size or font-family for instance)\n\nHow does this extension work?\nThis extension alters a cookie globally to turn the dark theme on and off. It also injects a lite script to the YouTube pages to alter the color scheme of the root element. In oppose to the other similar extensions, there is no resetting of the default theme or inverting the white theme with an inversion filter. Both of these methods are computationally inefficient. Instead, this extension asks YouTube to turn the native dark theme and only alter the global CSS variables to alter the colors.\nNote that this method only works if the product supports native coloring. Some Google products do not yet support this feature.\n\nPrivacy Policy: \nThis extension does not send or receive any data to any server whatsoever.\n\nBug Report:\nPlease either use the commenting section of the FAQs page or the GitHub page for bug reporting.\n\nChange Log:\n0.2.0\nUse the built-in dark theme (Material Design only)\n"

Whereas other counterparts, this add-on works in both normal and incognito modes and has the minimum possible impact on your web browsing performance.\n\nBy default, the extension is not available on incognito mode. You need to activate it by opening the extensions manager page (about://extensions) and check the \"Allow in incognito\" option. After the option is checked, the extension will appear in all windows, and JS blocking is covered on both modes.\n\nAfter installation, the extension is not active by default (JS execution is permitted). Whenever you need to block, click on the action button.\n\nException Lists:\nYou can define a domain list for both modes. The domains listed on the options page will allow JS execution, even when it is globally forbidden or vice versa. This is useful for those websites like Gmail that do not work without JS being enabled.\n\nAuto Reload:\nThe extension auto-refreshes the current tab after the toolbar button is toggled. If this is not your preferred behavior, use the options page to disable this. This is a forced refresh to bypass browser caches (similar to pressing Shift + F5 keyboard combination).\n\nSupported Types:\n1. Inline JavaScript on top and frame elements\n2. Data URI JavaScript on top and frame elements\n3. External JavaScript on top and frame elements\n4. Inline events\n5. \"javascript:\" URIs\n6. setTimeout evaluation\n7. \"document.write\" execution"

This is part of our Screenwise Panel program.\n\nThese panels are made up of volunteers who have certain activities measured and are compensated for their participation. Prior to participating, all panelists have a clear agreement with Google about what participation in the panels involves.\n\nFor more information, refer back to the research panel membership page if you are a panelist.

The extension configures your browser's proxy settings to tunnel the entire network requests through a local SOCKS5 proxy server. This server is available when the \"Tor\" executable is running. This extension also blocks WebRTC IP detection to prevent your real IP address to leak.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Improves the user's privacy by hiding the real IP address\n2. Dynamically changing the proxy configuration of your browser only when active. Changes revert when the extension is not working.\n3. Configures WebRTC to not reveal private IP addresses when the extension is active. This is an optional feature.\n4. It is possible to request a new identity (new IP) right from the extension whenever needed.\n5. There is no conflict with other running instances of Tor (like Tor Browser). This extension uses its unique communication port.\n\nNotes:\nFor this extension to run the Tor executable, you will need to install a NodeJS native client. This is a bridge connector to allow the extension to execute Tor. You will get a notification on the first use to install this native client.\n\nPlease read FAQ #1 on the homepage of the extension to prepare the extension to use the Tor executable. For now, the Tor bundle is prepared for Mac OS and Windows. On Linux, install the tor as usual and set the path on the options page.\n"

Check out what Paul Irish of Google wrote about NiM... https://twitter.com/june07t/status/861664828909264896.\n\nNiM manages the Edge DevTools window/tab life-cycle leaving you with more ability to focus on what matters... debugging your code.  You no longer need to copy/paste DevTools URL's or continue opening/closing tabs/windows.\n\nNiM automatically detects the URL that is generated when running node (locally or remotely) with --inspect option. NiM provides you with the option of automatically opening and closing Edge DevTools in a tab or window. Just toggle the Manual/Auto setting and then start a debugging session.  DevTools will open either on clicking the \"Open DevTools\" button or after the specified timeout period.  If set to auto close, once you end your debugging session, DevTools will close automatically.\n \nFeatures:\n - Manage and monitor local and remote debugging sessions\n - Manual or automatic control of DevTools interface\n - Open DevTools in a new tab or window\n - Make DevTools focused or inactive on start\n - Customize duration between v8 Inspector probes\n - Auto-save settings\n - Set custom DevTools bundle\n - Debug node processes launched by VSCode\n\nNote: By it's nature this extension requires permissions which\n\"Read and change all your data on the websites you visit\"\n\nFurther to better serve and understand my user base the following permission is asked\n\"Know your email address\"\n\nThe following URL will provide what I feel to be an informed viewpoint on the whole matter of permissions:  https://palant.de/2016/07/02/why-mozilla-shouldn-t-copy-chrome-s-permission-prompt-for-extensions\n\nNo information will ever be shared with 3rd parties.  Further the source is open and available on GitHub.  Please feel free to reach out to me 667@june07.com if you have any other concerns as I am open to discussion.  Should any policies change there will be notice given of such changes.\n\nAt the time of writing, the v8 --inspect option is fairly new. See https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html#debugger_v8_inspector_integration_for_node_js for additional details on the option.d\n\nIf you enjoy using NiM please give us a 5 star rating and/or a G+1.  Any and all feedback is encouraged and welcome.  667@june07.com  Thank you in advance.\n\nThis project is open source and available at https://github.com/june07/NiM."

Perhaps, you could again enjoy this game even when you are away from friends because it is now available online and can be accessed anywhere and anytime through your mobile phone.\n\nThis game has become very popular among children and adult alike. And just like the traditional game, its online version has practically the same rules and objective. In the game Connect 4, two players will be playing against each other. They will be given two different sets of discs with different colors in order to be able to identify whose disc belongs to who.\n\nOnce the game begins, the players will alternately drop their discs into the vertically suspended grid. It is said that the player who drops their disc first has a greater chance of winning. That is why most players would grab the chance to be able to have the first drop. Perhaps, this may be true in some way, but it does not definitely define the game. As long as both players play according to their strategy, then both will have a fair chance of winning.\n\nWinning the game Connect 4 entails that the players be able to complete a set of four discs in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal manner. The player who is able to achieve either of those first will then be declared as the winner."

This way you can look more deeply on the words. And it just looks like a traditional dictionary app. It has auto-completion function, word history, keyboard shortcuts, real human pronunciation and many more. Some example dictionaries include Urban dictionary, Oxford, Cambridge, Longman, Thesaurus, Merrian webster, Collins and Wikipedia etc.  \n\nMy goal is providing a universal tool to look up any word in any language, currently more dictionaries are needed, and more user reviews are wanted to improve its usability, HELP me on github!\n\nBut it's not just a dictionary app, it's a tool to help you learn. So the basic learning flow is like this: reading an article, looking up new words, exporting them to Anki after finish the article.\n\nJoin me on [Telegram](https://t.me/worldlanguagelearner) & [Discord](https://discord.gg/sazRac4kSa) to learn languages together. We would talk about linguistics, programming, and even have virtual meetings once for a while. \n\nNew: With the launch of [pnlpal community](https://pnlpal.dev/topic/2/), you can share your reading with pals all over the world now. No matter it's a news story, or a technical review, or even a youtube video. As long as it benefits our programming and language community, you could share it. [Check it](https://pnlpal.dev) by yourself. Let's learn together, and grow together.\n\nSome functions you might like:\n\n* Automatically pronounce in real American and British accent on English lookup.\n* Native app like dictionary interface, auto suggestions when you input.\n* Keep your words in history, and you can manage or export them.\n* Keyboard shortcuts to make life easier.\n* Muiltiple dictionaries query at the same time.\n* Export world list to Anki, supports pronunciation and images.\n\nBest of all, it's open-source!

Regular expressions support capturing parantheses so you could define the pattern: http://foo.com/bar.php\\?id=(\\d+) and define the redirect as http://bar.com/baz.php?id=$1. In that case http://foo.com/bar.php?id=1234 would automatically redirect to http://bar.com/baz.php?id=1234. Wildcards can also use $1,$2 in the redirect urls, $1 is the contents of the first star match, $2 of the second and so on.\n\nClick on the Redirector button next to your address bar to get started adding and editing redirects, and use the Enable/Disable button to quickly disable the addon."

    "description": "Pride and Prejudice is a romantic novel of manners written by Jane Austen in 1813. The novel follows the character development of Elizabeth Bennet, the dynamic protagonist of the book who learns about the repercussions of hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between superficial goodness and actual goodness. Its humour lies in its honest depiction of manners, education, marriage, and money during the Regency era in Great Britain.\n\nMr. Bennet of Longbourn estate has five daughters, but his property is entailed and can only be passed to a male heir. His wife also lacks an inheritance, so his family will be destitute upon his death. Thus, it is imperative that at least one of the girls marry well to support the others, which is a motivation that drives the plot. The novel revolves around the importance of marrying for love rather than money or social prestige, despite the communal pressure to make a wealthy match.\n"

It also improve browsing speed! Most ads aren't even downloaded at all, saving you time and bandwidth.\n\n\n✔ FEATURES:\n\n★ All ads blocked by default.\n★ Block video ads on YouTube.\n★ Customize your filter lists.\n★ See how many ads you've blocked.\n★ White-list your favorite sites in a snap.\n★ Available in over 30 languages\n★ Speed up your browser. Most ads aren't even downloaded at all.\n★ Quick and easy in-page ad reporting.\n\nIt's your browser. What you see should be up to you. AdBlock works automatically, but it only takes a couple clicks to permanently allow ads on any page, or an entire domain. \n\n\n✔ USAGE\n\nThe big power button in the popup is to permanently disable/enable Adblock for the current web site. It applies to the current web site only, it is not a global power button.\n\n\n✔ FILTERS\n\nIt's more than an \"ad blocker\": it can also read and create filters from hosts files.\n\nOut of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:\n\n- EasyList\n- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list\n- EasyPrivacy\n- Malware domains\n\nMore lists are available for you to select if you wish:\n\n- Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List\n- Dan Pollock’s hosts file\n- hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers\n- MVPS HOSTS\n- Spam404\n- And many others\n\nOf course, the more filters enabled, the higher the memory footprint. Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, Hosts’s Ad and tracking servers, Adblock still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n\n✔ FREE\n\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\n\n\n✔ PRIVACY PERMISSIONS\n\nAdblock does not monitor nor collect your browsing history or your personal information to function properly. When installing, Microsoft Edge browser automatically shows a permission notice about access to your history and website data as it would with any other adblock/adblocker. This is a standard message, we never collect any personally identifiable information whatsoever!"

Im März 2017 erteilte die nach Gesetzesnovelle nunmehr dafür zuständige Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle Multimedia-Diensteanbieter e.V. (FSM) der neuen JusProg-Software für Windows ebenfalls die gesetzliche Anerkennung, die damit als einzige allgemeine Software die Anforderungen des § 11 JMStV erfüllt.

Sniping is part of the eBay experience, and all bids placed before a listing ends are valid, even if they're placed one second before the listing ends.\" (http://pages.ebay.com/help/buy/outbid.html)\n\nHow does it work?\nBids placed with Snip.pl are exactly the same as if they were placed by hand. Exactly the same. Snip.pl is not a \"hack\" to eBay site. It obeys all and all eBay's rules. What is different, is that the whole process is fully automated, so you don't have to do anything."

Privacy by design.\n\nMEGA is a secure, user-controlled end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and communications service with 20 GB free storage space. Unlike other cloud storage providers, your data is encrypted and decrypted by your client devices only and never by us.\n\nThis extension allows you to install MEGA into your browser to reduce loading times, improve download performance and strengthen security. Any MEGA URL will be captured by this extension and stay local (no JavaScript will be loaded from our servers).\n\nMEGA’s source code files (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) are loaded from the extension itself and do not require additional integrity verification. This saves time by not downloading these files from MEGA’s servers and verifying them each time you visit the MEGA website. The executable client code runs directly on users' local machines, rather than being loaded from MEGA over TLS/SSL. Browser extension updates are cryptographically protected. For more information see section 2.2 of our whitepaper https://mega.io/SecurityWhitepaper.pdf.\n\nSecurity reviewers can find our source code at https://mega.io/sourcecode.\n\nUsers wanting additional storage and bandwidth above the free tier can purchase plans at https://mega.nz/pro.

The software as well as the content is free to use for anyone.\n\nYou can get the whole of Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikivoyage, Gutenberg books, etc., on your device completely offline in your own language. You can have amazing reference tools at your fingertips wherever you are. Just download your chosen archive and store it on your device (see instructions from About page of app). Great for travelling, or any place where access to the Internet is difficult or expensive! Often faster than Wikipedia for quick consultation.\n\nThis app reads a larger offline file that you can download to your device. You must download the archive separately (see About tab in the app for instructions). Offline files are available for Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikivoyage, Wikimedicine, Wikimaths, TED Talks, Project Gutenberg, etc., in all the available Wikipedia languages.\n\nThis extension is very handy, always a click away in your browser. However, if you are using Windows 10/11, you can also find a convenient, self-updating UWP version of this app in the Microsoft Store (also made by Kiwix). It runs independently of the browser (search for Kiwix JS in the Store). There are also packaged versions which include the latest WikiMed (Medical Wikipedia), and Wikivoyage (just search for them in the Microsoft Store).\n\nPlease note that with this browser extension, unlike with the app versions, you will need to pick your ZIM file each time you open the app (this is an API limitation).\n\nIf you are interested in the full range of Kiwix apps, including for iOS and Android, please visit www.kiwix.org."

Time is tracked as \"Active\" if you press keys or move the mouse more often than 1 time in 30 seconds. If a user is inactive more than 30 seconds but the browser is in focus, TimeYourWeb counts only \"Total\" time. \"Total\" time shows you how long you were watching video on YouTube or other video-sharing sites or just kept your browser opened.\n\nTimeYourWeb allows you to order summary data by \"Total\" or by \"Active\" time or site names.\nClick by any page opens visited page in new Edge tab.

It could be Saturday, Sunday or Monday. Monday is default.\n3) define URLs that won't be tracked. TimeYourWeb checks each URL for correspondence to \"Ignoring rules\". If URL start and \"Ignoring rule\" are equal then URL will be ignored.\n\n  Ignoring Rules examples:\n    - \"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?tab=wm#spam\" - don't track time spent on spam checking in Gmail.\n    - \"https://mail.google.com\" - do not track any activity in Gmail\n    - \"edge://newtab\" - don't track time spent on new Tab\n    - \"file://\" - don't track time spent on any local file\n\nFAQ\n\nQuestion: Does it track the time when I watch a film online?\nAnswer: Yes, if browser is in focus. \"Total\" Time shows the period you was watching the film.\n\nQuestion: Does TimeYourWeb have any access to viewed pages?\nAnswer: No, it doesn't. TimeYourWeb only tracks URLs visited by you, no more.\n\nQuestion: Is TimeYourWeb free?\nAnswer: All current and most future features of TimeYourWeb are free and will be free forever.\nHowever, we are going to add some useful features which need servers. Server time costs money.\nSo this features will be paid.\n\n\nFuture plans\n\nWe are going to expand TimeYourWeb with next capabilities:\n- possibility for deleting day data\n- user accounts with authentication\n- synchronization between several computers\n\n\nPermissions\n\nTimeYourWeb is the lowest permission required among another Edge extension time trackers.\nTimeYourWeb requires \"Read you browsing history\": to allow the extension to read current tab's domain, icon and title.\n\n\nContacts\nEmail: timeyourweb[ at ]gmail.com"

    "description": "Are you looking for an online game that is not only fun but also makes you think critically? Then you are at the right place, here we have the game backgammon. Traditionally, it is a board game whose origins can be traced thousands of years ago. But today, in the modern times, it is now available as an online game in order to level with the changing times.\n\nJust like the traditional board game, the online backgammon has the same rules. It is also played by two players: either you play against a computer or against someone else who is also online but may not necessarily be in the same area where you are playing. Each of the players is given fifteen pieces and will alternately take a move depending on the result of the role of the dice. When playing this game, it is important to have a good strategy wherein you can easily modify as the game progresses depending on the moves of your opponent.\n\nA winner is declared only when one of the players are able to completely move all of their fifteen pieces off the board. However, winning the game is not as easy as it may seem. A single game of backgammon may take between five to sixty minutes depending on the player’s strategy and tactics and their luck once their roll the dice. This game is indeed a good opportunity for adults and children alike to train their minds and see how lucky they are."

The color selections are shown together with their Hex code values in the boxes below the palette.\nThe color picker will also display the colors to different formats (i.e.,  HEX, RGB, HSV, HSL, CMYK).\n\nEyedropper:\nUse the Eyedropper by right-clicking on the page and selecting \"Pick a color on the page\". You can also use the Eyedropper button on the Eyedropper tab of the extension's popup. \nNote that colors are picked from a snapshot of the viewable area of the page. Make sure you scroll to the area of the page that you want to select colors from before starting the eyedropper. Also note that some pages (e.g., file://) have security  that prevent eyedropper from working.  The Color Picker tracks a history of the colors you've selected with the eyedropper. You can see the history on the Color Picker's Eyedropper tab.\nOn hi-dpi (high resolution) screens the eyedropper snapshot may appear blurry.\n\nColor Scale:\nUse the color scale to create a set of visually pleasing colors that are evenly spaced. If you are creating any type of chart or map that relies on colors to visually distinguish elements (or data values) in your chart or map you'll find this very hard to do manually and the results will likely be not ideal - often leaving the viewer to guess the intent of the color. This tool will produce a pleasing color scale from the start and end colors you select. Select from different color modes to get your favorite colors.\n\nColor Blender:\nUse the color blender to blend two colors using RGB channel-wise blend functions.\n\nYou can also type or paste a Hex code into the text fields to get a particular color.  \n\nThis tool is useful if you :\n- to create a four color personalized 4-color palette\n- find the color code of a color on a web page with the eyedropper\n- to create a color scale from 3 to 25 colors for use in bar charts, maps, etc.\n- blend two colors using different modes\n\nFeatures:\n- available as an icon on your toolbar\n- remembers the current state so when you reopen the color picker you can carry on where you left off.\n- convenient buttons to copy color codes to the clipboard and save codes to a text file\n- A dark-mode option allows you to view the color picker with a dark background and white text\n- provides links to other tools from LinangData from the More tools menu, including: Grammar, spelling and style checker; Dictionary; Calculator; Photo Editor; Sketch; Exif Data Viewer; Weather Forecast; World Clock, the LinangData Youtube channel, our sponsors\n- It's free!"

You can either browser files via the (+) button at the UI (top-left corner) or drag & drop a file in the left textarea. The former method is preferred as the coding language for the input file can be detected automatically and the interface will be updated accordingly (no need to adjust the input language manually). \n\nCode Beautifier can work offline without the need for an internet connection. It uses an open-source library \"js-beautify\" available in this (https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify) GitHub repo. Moreover, it also uses the famous CodeMirror (https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror) library to format the input and output codes. Within the interface, there are several buttons at the top toolbar which are self-explanatory. There is also a settings list at the top which contains several options for the beautifier. Change any desired settings and see the live result in the output field. To download the beautified result, please click on the download button at the top toolbar.\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/code-beautifier.html)."

This is practically a game wherein you will be able to maximize the use of your memory.\n\nThis will help you gauge whether your memory is working as it should or there are no signs of aging. By means of playing memory games such as this, you can help maintain a healthy and sharp memory. These games will stimulate your brain and are a good way to exercise stagnant brains of the oldies. And for the younger ones, memory games will help them develop a much sharper memory.\n\nThe game Color Memory is very easy to play. All you have to do is to take note of the pattern of colors and repeat them by clicking the correct series. It may be very simple at first especially during the first few rounds wherein the color patterns are only a few, however, as the game progresses, it will eventually become a hefty task especially when your brain is not trained to recall so many things for a short period of time. \n\nThat is why many first time players of this game will easily reach a game over because they tend to forget the pattern and just click a random color without really being sure that it is the right color in the given pattern.\n\nIndeed the game Color Memory is an excellent mind enhancing a game that will definitely help in the development and the improvement of the brain."

I wanted to enlarge the font-size of Chinese characters without changing the size of English text or any other elements on the page.\n\nHow does it work?\nThe current version of Hanzisize is able to selectively resize Arabic, Burmese, Chinese, English, Georgian, Korean, Hebrew, Hindi, Japanese, and Thai text. Other languages may be added later based on demand.\n\nThe current functionality allows for easy increasing and decreasing font-size on the page with a few limitations.\nThe font size of an element can never be smaller than it was when the page was first loaded. This prevents headers and other large font size elements from shrinking while small paragraph text is enlarged.\n\nPrivacy\nHanzisize does not collect or transmit any user data. The only information that is stored are the most recent language and font size settings for user convenience. This data is stored in the user's browser and is not transmitted externally or used for any other purpose.\n\nDonate\nHi there. I'm Ryan, the sole developer of Hanzisize. I've spent hundreds of hours working on Hanzisize while making it available for anyone to use for free. If you are able, please consider donating so I can continue to improve this tool for all of us. If you're not able to donate, please leave a review of this extension on the Edge webstore so more people can find it. Thanks for your support!\nYou can show your appreciation for Hanzisize by donating in the following ways:\n\nBuy Me A Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/djmouthguard\nBitcoin: bc1q4524l0qtj5ucjw8qvxdpd7vta7x9peyazd8ykc\nOr check out my Redbubble store: www.redbubble.com/people/djmouthguard/shop\n\nHave a suggestion about how to improve Hanzisize?\nYou can email me at hanzisizeextension@gmail.com, or if you have a Github account you can create an \"Issue\" at https://github.com/rjpeterson/Hanzisize/issues and let me know how you think Hanzisize can be improved!"

    "description": "Piano Prime is a fun, and very simple piano extension for your browser.\n\nThis addon is a lite and very easy-to-use app for playing or learning Piano. You can play your favorite song with the built-in keyboard, or mouse. There is also an option to record desired song(s) and replay it at any time. In total, there are 52 keyboard keys but only 20 of them are visible when you install the App for the first time. This number can be changed from the options page. A setting is available to hide the built-in keyboard (top section). Moreover, the sustain-control option makes bits last a bit longer (for a more professional playing).\n\nFew features:\n1. The App and all the settings are auto-saved to the memory.\n2. You can play piano with the keyboard, mouse, or the built-in keyboard at the top.\n3. Number of visible keys is adjustable to your desired choice (default is 27).\n4. You can hide the keyboard from the options page.\n5. There is also a sustain control key to match sounds to your need (default is off).\n6. You can record or replay any song(s) from the sidebar settings panel.\n\nNote: to report bugs, please fill the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/piano.html)."

You could even do this blind-folded.\n\nYour window needs to be maximized to work.\n\nUnlike typical mouse gestures extensions, this extension is more intuitive and faster to operate because it only requires one click. It does not require coordination between two fingers. It also does not require performing the drag and drop gesture, which requires two actions to be performed at the same time."

We support charities that help to fight climate change and alleviate the suffering caused by climate change.

You’d like to get those tabs out of the way sometimes, but they’re maybe not worth saving as actual bookmarks.\n\nIn the Edge browser, Microsoft has introduced a new feature called \"Tabs aside\" (or Tab groups) which lets you set tabs aside in a sort of temporary workspace so that you can call them back up later.\n\nUnfortunately, in new Chromium-based Microsoft Edge, the devs decided not to implement this must-have-feature. So, I've decided to create a browser extension which replicates this awesome feature in Chromium-based browsers\n\n## Features\n- Familiar UI inherited from legacy Microsoft Edge with some improvements\n- Auto Dark mode\n- Now you can restore one tab from collection without removing\n- Convenient hotkeys\n- Ability to load restored tabs on your demand\n\n## Hey, It's open-source software!\nIf you know how to improve this extension you can check its GitHub Repository at https://github.com/xfox111/ChromiumTabsAside\nCheck out release changelog on https://github.com/xfox111/chromiumtabsaside/releases/latest"

    "description": "This extension works as a standalone audio player that supports many audio formats. It can play audio files by dropping them into the interface. It also can play the audio stream of video containers. The extension uses the well-known FFmpeg library to decode audio files. It supports FLV, WMA, MP3, MP4, WebM, and many more codecs.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Boost audio level up to twice its original value (volume goes up to 200%, similar to the VLC Player)\n2. Play almost all known media files (audio streams only)\n3. Supports media keys (Play, Pause, Resume, Next and Previous Tracks)\n4. Plays multiple files sequentially like a Desktop media player\n5. Works offline\n6. Written purely in JavaScript\n7. Shuffle playlist\n8. Repeat single track or all tracks\n9. Supports keyboard shortcuts\n10. Supports playlist (increase the height of the player to see the playlist)\n\n\nThis extension is meant to fulfill the audio playback needs of the users on all operating systems without having to install a native application.\n\nUse Cases:\n1. If you are on an OS that does not allow you to install a media player or have Chromium OS.\n2. You want to play the audio stream only. Most media players can only play both video and audio. For instance, you have a recorded media from a concert, and you just want to listen to the audio while working.\n\nHow to Use:\nDownload a media file that the browser can not play (it does not support the codec). Drop the file into the audio player.\nYou can use https://webbrowsertools.com/test-download-with/ to get AVI or FLV sample files.\n\nTechnical Notes:\n1. This extension only complied with the decoder section of the FFmpeg library. It can decode almost all types of known audio codecs.\n2. It uses Emscripten to compile FFMPeg to WASM."

    "description": "\"Reverse Image Search\" extension helps you to find similar images or the original image source and its name. This is a useful tool to find for instance the actual image name or detect whether this image is unique or is just a copy or a modified copy of an already existed image on the web.\n\nIn most cases, images are embedded in the background page and hence it is not straightforward to find the actual source of them to be passed to a reverse image search engine. Also, the image you are looking for maybe just part of a video stream. This extension solves these problems by providing a capturing tool in the right-click context menu. Simply select the item and capture a portion of the screen. The captured image is automatically sent to either \"TinEye\" or \"Google Images\" search engine, and after a successful upload, a new page with the matching results is displayed.\n\nThis extension adds three items to the context menu of your browser:\n1. Google Images (Image URL)\n2. Tineye (Image URL)\n3. Google Images (Capture)\n\nThe first two items are added to the image context menu, and the third one is added to the page context to activate the capturing tool. Instead of the third option, you can alternatively press the browser action button.\n\nLinks:\nFAQs Page: https://add0n.com/reverse-image-search.html\nGitHub Page: https://github.com/schomery/reverse-image-search/"
