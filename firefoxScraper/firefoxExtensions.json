This helps ensure the item you are considering buying comes from a seller who has an acceptable reputation. Avoid problems ahead of time and look for red flags as past negative experiences can also happen to you in the future. Save time and money with 1 click (instead of Ebay's pages which may be 20+ pages long).\n\nAddon uses 3rd party site (www.knowyourfeedback.com) for operation.\n\nPrivacy: No user information of your own is collected. Only history on the profile-of-interest is collected (and also this information is not stored for more than 1 day, and only in temporary memory). Information collected is all public on ebay user profiles (with no login required to view the ebay feedback). Our app simply makes the publicly available information easy to read in a 1-page list format.\n\neBay Inc. is a multinational e-commerce corporation, facilitating online consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales. It is headquartered in San Jose, California. eBay was founded by Pierre Omidyar in 1995, and became a notable success story of the dot-com bubble. Today eBay is a multibillion-dollar business with operations in about 30 countries.\n\nThe company manages eBay.com, an online auction and shopping website in which people and businesses buy and sell a broad variety of goods and services worldwide. In addition to its auction-style sales, the website has since expanded to include \"Buy It Now\" shopping; shopping by UPC, ISBN, or other kind of SKU number (via Half.com); online classified advertisements (via Kijiji or eBay Classifieds); online event ticket trading (via StubHub); and other services. It previously offered online money transfers (via PayPal, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of eBay from 2002 until 2015). The website is free to use for buyers, but sellers are charged fees for listing items after a limited number of free listings, and again when those items are sold.",

    "description": "1000 Bots is a simple web extension which changes your browser’s user agent to that of the Googlebot. Googlebot is a web crawler which surfs the web extensively to build a searchable index for the Google search engine (making it one of the most influential Internet users. Only what it sees is indexed and can later be found by other users). By changing your settings to match those of Googlebot, you become one of thousands of Google web crawlers browsing the web to index its contents.\n\nSurfing the web as Googlebot gives you access to what is referred to as the grey web, a layer of content only visible to bots. In some cases it might give you access to websites and archives that are usually hidden behind a paywall. Because while the website owner will present the regular user with a login page, they will give web crawlers access to their full archive in order for it to be represented in Google’s search results.\n\nStep 1:\n💻 Install the web extension\n\nStep 2:\n📡 To start surfing as Googlebot, clicking on the icon in the browser toolbar\n\nStep 3:\n🏄🏾‍♀️ Surf your favourite websites\n\nStep 4:\n🌐 Check RYBN's Double Negative Capchas to see if you pass the bot test.\nhttps://1000scores.com/portfolio-items/rybn-double-negative-captchas/\n(You might have to take the test twice until it works.)\n\n1000 Bots is an art piece by !Mediengruppe Bitnik commissioned by the website 1000scores.com & Literaturforum im Brecht-Haus Berlin.\n\nThe source code [1] for 1000 Bots is free software and published under the GNU GPLv3. 1000 Bots is a response to RYBN's wonderful work Double Negative Captchas.\n\n<3 !Mediengruppe Bitnik\n\n[1] source code: https://wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.bitnik.org/data/code/1000_bots_webextension.zip",

(/ˈiːˌbeɪ/ EE-bay, stylized as ebay) is a multinational e-commerce corporation, facilitating online consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales. It is headquartered in San Jose, California. eBay was founded by Pierre Omidyar in 1995, and became a notable success story of the dot-com bubble. Today eBay is a multibillion-dollar business with operations in about 30 countries.\n\nThe company manages eBay.com, an online auction and shopping website in which people and businesses buy and sell a broad variety of goods and services worldwide. In addition to its auction-style sales, the website has since expanded to include \"Buy It Now\" shopping; shopping by UPC, ISBN, or other kind of SKU number (via Half.com); online classified advertisements (via Kijiji or eBay Classifieds); online event ticket trading (via StubHub); and other services. It previously offered online money transfers (via PayPal, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of eBay from 2002 until 2015). The website is free to use for buyers, but sellers are charged fees for listing items after a limited number of free listings, and again when those items are sold.",

Introduction about private internet connection and areas of its use. Most common questions.\n\n\nWhat is a VPN connection?\n\nVPN is a Virtual Private Network that connects you to the encrypted secure network across the publick network connection. VPN masks the real IP address and location by creating a secure internet connection over a public wi-fi network. VPN is good for anonymously and privately browsing the web as VPN encrypts data with modern protocols.\n\nVPNs use virtual connections to create a private network. During the usage of a public wi-fi, VPN helps to keep your data safe from hackers and malware and protect data from unauthorized access.\n\n\nHow does VPN work?\n\nVPN sends your data through the encrypted tunnel that makes your connection private and securely. While you connect to one of our remote servers your real ip address is masked and all data goes securely to the final destination.\n\nVPN connection broadens a private network over a public network and allows users to send and receive requests over public networks as if their computers are directly connected to the private network.\n\n\nIs it safe to use a VPN connection?\n\nVPN connection uses the modern data encryption protocols. One of the main VPN functions is to encrypt user data and browsing history to protect them from hackers and ISPs. The core feature of a VPN is to hide real IP addresses of users and prevent anyone from tracking their online activity.\n\nWhy do I need to use a virtual private network?\n\nVPNs are good in protecting your data or masking real location when watching a movie from a streaming website that is prohibited in your country. A VPN connection hides your data traffic online and protects it from unwanted access. While you browse without a VPN connection the data can be viewed by anyone who has an intention to see it. With VPN, hackers and intruders cannot decrypt this data.\n\nCan I use a VPN server privately?\n\nVPN service provides private browser sessions, as with VPN connection your online activity is not stored or tracked and your IP address and physical location are hidden. All data and requests you send via encrypted network tunnel is securely shield from hackers and illegal trackers. Secure VPN connection protects a user’s activity while they browse the internet.\n\nIs it legal to connect to VPN?\n\nUsing Virtual private networks is legal and acceptable in the majority of countries. Big corporations often use the VPN to connect their employers to a private network for secure data transmitting and connecting them remotely to any sources. Anyway, you should use private networks according to the law and avoid illegal activity on the internet.",
